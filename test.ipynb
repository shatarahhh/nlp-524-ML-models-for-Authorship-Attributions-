       "'the adventure of “the western star”\\ni was standing at the window of poirot’s rooms looking out idly on\\nthe street below “that’s queer ” i ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath “what is _mon ami_ ” asked poirot placidly from the depths of\\nhis comfortable chair “deduce poirot from the following facts here is a young lady richly dressed—fashionable hat magnificent furs she is coming\\nalong slowly looking up at the houses as she goes unknown to her she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman they\\nhave just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl gesticulating as he does so what drama is this being played is\\nthe girl a crook and are the shadowers detectives preparing to\\narrest her or are _they_ the scoundrels and are they plotting to\\nattack an innocent victim what does the great detective say ”\\n“the great detective _mon ami_ chooses as ever the simplest\\ncourse he rises to see for himself ” and my friend joined me at\\nthe window in a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle “as usual your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism that is miss mary marvell the film star she is being followed by\\na bevy of admirers who have recognized her and _en passant_ my\\ndear hastings she is quite aware of the fact ”\\ni laughed “so all is explained but you get no marks for that poirot it\\nwas a mere matter of recognition ”\\n“_en vérité _ and how many times have you seen mary marvell on the\\nscreen _mon cher_ ”\\ni thought “about a dozen times perhaps ”\\n“and i—once yet _i_ recognize her and _you_ do not ”\\n“she looks so different ” i replied rather feebly “ah _sacré_ ” cried poirot “is it that you expect her to promenade\\nherself in the streets of london in a cowboy hat or with bare\\nfeet and a bunch of curls as an irish colleen always with you\\nit is the non-essentials remember the case of the dancer valerie\\nsaintclair ”\\ni shrugged my shoulders slightly annoyed “but console yourself _mon ami_ ” said poirot calming down “all\\ncannot be as hercule poirot i know it well ”\\n“you really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone i ever\\nknew ” i cried divided between amusement and annoyance “what will you when one is unique one knows it and others share\\nthat opinion—even if i mistake not miss mary marvell ”\\n“what ”\\n“without doubt she is coming here ”\\n“how do you make that out ”\\n“very simply this street it is not aristocratic _mon ami_ in\\nit there is no fashionable doctor no fashionable dentist—still\\nless is there a fashionable milliner but there _is_ a fashionable\\ndetective _oui_ my friend it is true—i am become the mode the\\n_dernier cri_ one says to another: ‘_comment _ you have lost your\\ngold pencil-case you must go to the little belgian he is too\\nmarvellous every one goes _courez ’_ and they arrive in flocks _mon ami_ with problems of the most foolish ” a bell rang below “what did i tell you that is miss marvell ”\\nas usual poirot was right after a short interval the american\\nfilm star was ushered in and we rose to our feet mary marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on\\nthe screen she had only lately arrived in england in company with\\nher husband gregory b rolf also a film actor their marriage\\nhad taken place about a year ago in the states and this was their\\nfirst visit to england they had been given a great reception every one was prepared to go mad over mary marvell her wonderful\\nclothes her furs her jewels above all one jewel the great\\ndiamond which had been nicknamed to match its owner “the western\\nstar ” much true and untrue had been written about this famous\\nstone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of\\nfifty thousand pounds all these details passed rapidly through my mind as i joined with\\npoirot in greeting our fair client miss marvell was small and slender very fair and girlish-looking with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child poirot drew forward a chair for her and she commenced talking at\\nonce “you will probably think me very foolish monsieur poirot but lord\\ncronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up\\nthe mystery of his nephew’s death and i felt that i just must have\\nyour advice i dare say it’s only a silly hoax—gregory says so—but\\nit’s just worrying me to death ”\\nshe paused for breath poirot beamed encouragement “proceed madame you comprehend i am still in the dark ”\\n“it’s these letters ” miss marvell unclasped her handbag and drew\\nout three envelopes which she handed to poirot the latter scrutinized them closely “cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed let us see\\nthe inside ” he drew out the enclosure i had joined him and was leaning over his shoulder the writing\\nconsisted of a single sentence carefully printed like the envelope it ran as follows:\\n“the great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return\\nwhence it came ”\\nthe second letter was couched in precisely the same terms but the\\nthird was more explicit:\\n“you have been warned you have not obeyed now the diamond will\\nbe taken from you at the full of the moon the two diamonds which\\nare the left and right eye of the god shall return so it is\\nwritten ”\\n“the first letter i treated as a joke ” explained miss marvell “when i got the second i began to wonder the third one came\\nyesterday and it seemed to me that after all the matter might\\nbe more serious than i had imagined ”\\n“i see they did not come by post these letters ”\\n“no; they were left by hand—by a _chinaman _ that is what frightens\\nme ”\\n“why ”\\n“because it was from a chink in san francisco that gregory bought\\nthe stone three years ago ”\\n“i see madame that you believe the diamond referred to to be——”\\n“‘the western star ’” finished miss marvell “that’s so at the\\ntime gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the\\nstone but the chink wasn’t handing out any information gregory\\nsays he seemed just scared to death and in a mortal hurry to get\\nrid of the thing he only asked about a tenth of its value it was\\ngreg’s wedding present to me ”\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully “the story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism and yet—who\\nknows i pray of you hastings hand me my little almanac ”\\ni complied “_voyons _” said poirot turning the leaves “when is the date of the full moon ah friday next that is in\\nthree days’ time _eh bien_ madame you seek my advice—i give it\\nto you this _belle histoire_ may be a hoax—but it may not therefore i counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until\\nafter friday next then we can take what steps we please ”\\na slight cloud passed over the actress’s face and she replied\\nconstrainedly:\\n“i’m afraid that’s impossible ”\\n“you have it with you—_hein_ ” poirot was watching her narrowly the girl hesitated a moment then slipped her hand into the bosom\\nof her gown drawing out a long thin chain she leaned forward unclosing her hand in the palm a stone of white fire exquisitely\\nset in platinum lay and winked at us solemnly poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss “_épatant _” he murmured “you permit madame ” he took the jewel\\nin his own hand and scrutinized it keenly then restored it to her\\nwith a little bow “a magnificent stone—without a flaw ah _cent\\ntonnerres _ and you carry it about with you _comme ça_ ”\\n“no no i’m very careful really monsieur poirot as a rule it’s\\nlocked up in my jewel-case and left in the hotel safe deposit we’re staying at the _magnificent_ you know i just brought it\\nalong to-day for you to see ”\\n“and you will leave it with me _n’est-ce pas_ you will be advised\\nby papa poirot ”\\n“well you see it’s this way monsieur poirot on friday we’re\\ngoing down to yardly chase to spend a few days with lord and lady\\nyardly ”\\nher words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind some\\ngossip—what was it now a few years ago lord and lady yardly had\\npaid a visit to the states rumour had it that his lordship had\\nrather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady\\nfriends—but surely there was something more some gossip which\\ncoupled lady yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in\\ncalifornia—why it came to me in a flash—of course it was none\\nother than gregory b rolf “i’ll let you into a little secret monsieur poirot ” miss marvell\\nwas continuing “we’ve got a deal on with lord yardly there’s some\\nchance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral\\npile ”\\n“at yardly chase ” i cried interested “why it’s one of the show\\nplaces of england ”\\nmiss marvell nodded “i guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right but he wants a\\npretty stiff price and of course i don’t know yet whether the deal\\nwill go through but greg and i always like to combine business\\nwith pleasure ”\\n“but—i demand pardon if i am dense madame—surely it is possible\\nto visit yardly chase without taking the diamond with you ”\\na shrewd hard look came into miss marvell’s eyes which belied\\ntheir childlike appearance she looked suddenly a good deal older “i want to wear it down there ”\\n“surely” i said suddenly “there are some very famous jewels in\\nthe yardly collection a large diamond amongst them ”\\n“that’s so ” said miss marvell briefly i heard poirot murmur beneath his breath: “ah _c’est comme ça_ ”\\nthen he said aloud with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the\\nbull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “then you\\nare without doubt already acquainted with lady yardly or perhaps\\nyour husband is ”\\n“gregory knew her when she was out west three years ago ” said miss\\nmarvell she hesitated a moment and then added abruptly: “do\\neither of you ever see _society gossip_ ”\\nwe both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly “i ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous\\njewels and it’s really very curious——” she broke off i rose went to the table at the other side of the room and returned\\nwith the paper in question in my hand she took it from me found\\nthe article and began to read aloud:\\n“ amongst other famous stones may be included the star of the\\neast a diamond in the possession of the yardly family an ancestor\\nof the present lord yardly brought it back with him from china and a romantic story is said to attach to it according to this the stone was once the right eye of a temple god another diamond exactly similar in form and size formed the left eye and the\\nstory goes that this jewel too would in course of time be stolen ‘one eye shall go west the other east till they shall meet once\\nmore then in triumph shall they return to the god ’ it is a\\ncurious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone\\ncorresponding closely in description with this one and known as\\n‘the star of the west ’ or ‘the western star ’ it is the property\\nof the celebrated film actress miss mary marvell a comparison of\\nthe two stones would be interesting ”\\nshe stopped “_épatant _” murmured poirot “without doubt a romance of the first\\nwater ” he turned to mary marvell “and you are not afraid madame you have no superstitious terrors you do not fear to introduce\\nthese two siamese twins to each other lest a chinaman should appear\\nand hey presto whisk them both back to china ”\\nhis tone was mocking but i fancied that an undercurrent of\\nseriousness lay beneath it “i don’t believe that lady yardly’s diamond is anything like as\\ngood a stone as mine ” said miss marvell “anyway i’m going to\\nsee ”\\nwhat more poirot would have said i do not know for at that moment\\nthe door flew open and a splendid-looking man strode into the\\nroom from his crisply curling black head to the tips of his\\npatent-leather boots he was a hero fit for romance “i said i’d call round for you mary ” said gregory rolf “and here\\ni am well what does monsieur poirot say to our little problem just one big hoax same as i do ”\\npoirot smiled up at the big actor they made a ridiculous contrast “hoax or no hoax mr rolf ” he said dryly “i have advised madame\\nyour wife not to take the jewel with her to yardly chase on friday ”\\n“i’m with you there sir i’ve already said so to mary but there she’s a woman through and through and i guess she can’t bear to\\nthink of another woman outshining her in the jewel line ”\\n“what nonsense gregory ” said mary marvell sharply but she\\nflushed angrily poirot shrugged his shoulders “madame i have advised i can do no more _c’est fini_ ”\\nhe bowed them both to the door “ah _la la_ ” he observed returning “_histoire de femmes _ the\\ngood husband he hit the nail on the head—_tout de même_ he was\\nnot tactful assuredly not ”\\ni imparted to him my vague remembrances and he nodded vigorously “so i thought all the same there is something curious underneath\\nall this with your permission _mon ami_ i will take the air await my return i beg of you i shall not be long ”\\ni was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door and put her head in “it’s another lady to see mr poirot sir i’ve told her he was\\nout but she says as how she’ll wait seeing as she’s come up from\\nthe country ”\\n“oh show her in here mrs murchison perhaps i can do something\\nfor her ”\\nin another moment the lady had been ushered in my heart gave a\\nleap as i recognized her lady yardly’s portrait had figured too\\noften in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown “do sit down lady yardly ” i said drawing forward a chair “my\\nfriend poirot is out but i know for a fact that he’ll be back very\\nshortly ”\\nshe thanked me and sat down a very different type this from miss\\nmary marvell tall dark with flashing eyes and a pale proud\\nface—yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth i felt a desire to rise to the occasion why not in poirot’s\\npresence i have frequently felt a difficulty—i do not appear at my\\nbest and yet there is no doubt that i too possess the deductive\\nsense in a marked degree i leant forward on a sudden impulse “lady yardly ” i said “i know why you have come here you have\\nreceived blackmailing letters about the diamond ”\\nthere was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home she stared at\\nme open-mouthed all colour banished from her cheeks “you know ” she gasped “how ”\\ni smiled “by a perfectly logical process if miss marvell has had warning\\nletters——”\\n“miss marvell she has been here ”\\n“she has just left as i was saying if she as the holder of one\\nof the twin diamonds has received a mysterious series of warnings you as the holder of the other stone must necessarily have done\\nthe same you see how simple it is i am right then you have\\nreceived these strange communications also ”\\nfor a moment she hesitated as though in doubt whether to trust me\\nor not then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile “that is so ” she acknowledged “were yours too left by hand—by a chinaman ”\\n“no they came by post; but tell me has miss marvell undergone\\nthe same experience then ”\\ni recounted to her the events of the morning she listened\\nattentively “it all fits in my letters are the duplicates of hers it is true\\nthat they came by post but there is a curious perfume impregnating\\nthem—something in the nature of joss-stick—that at once suggested\\nthe east to me what does it all mean ”\\ni shook my head “that is what we must find out you have the letters with you we\\nmight learn something from the postmarks ”\\n“unfortunately i destroyed them you understand at the time i\\nregarded it as some foolish joke can it be true that some chinese\\ngang are really trying to recover the diamonds it seems too\\nincredible ”\\nwe went over the facts again and again but could get no further\\ntowards the elucidation of the mystery at last lady yardly rose “i really don’t think i need wait for monsieur poirot you can tell\\nhim all this can’t you thank you so much mr ——”\\nshe hesitated her hand outstretched “captain hastings ”\\n“of course how stupid of me you’re a friend of the cavendishes aren’t you it was mary cavendish who sent me to monsieur poirot ”\\nwhen my friend returned i enjoyed telling him the tale of what\\nhad occurred during his absence he cross-questioned me rather\\nsharply over the details of our conversation and i could read\\nbetween the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent i also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined\\nto be jealous it had become rather a pose with him to consistently\\nbelittle my abilities and i think he was chagrined at finding no\\nloophole for criticism i was secretly rather pleased with myself though i tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him in\\nspite of his idiosyncrasies i was deeply attached to my quaint\\nlittle friend “_bien _” he said at length with a curious look on his face “the\\nplot develops pass me i pray you that ‘peerage’ on the top shelf\\nthere ” he turned the leaves “ah here we are ‘yardly 10th\\nviscount served south african war’ _tout ça n’a pas\\nd’importance_ ‘mar 1907 hon maude stopperton fourth\\ndaughter of 3rd baron cotteril’ um um um ‘has iss two daughters born 1908 1910 clubs residences ’ _voilà_ that does not tell us much but to-morrow morning we see\\nthis _milord_ ”\\n“what ”\\n“yes i telegraphed to him ”\\n“i thought you had washed your hands of the case ”\\n“i am not acting for miss marvell since she refuses to be guided\\nby my advice what i do now is for my own satisfaction—the\\nsatisfaction of hercule poirot decidedly i must have a finger in\\nthis pie ”\\n“and you calmly wire lord yardly to dash up to town just to suit\\nyour convenience he won’t be pleased ”\\n“_au contraire_ if i preserve for him his family diamond he ought\\nto be very grateful ”\\n“then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen ” i\\nasked eagerly “almost a certainty ” replied poirot placidly “everything points\\nthat way ”\\n“but how——”\\npoirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand “not now i pray you let us not confuse the mind and observe that\\n‘peerage’—how you have replaced him see you not that the tallest\\nbooks go in the top shelf the next tallest in the row beneath and so on thus we have order _method_ which as i have often\\ntold you hastings——”\\n“exactly ” i said hastily and put the offending volume in its\\nproper place • • • • • • •\\nlord yardly turned out to be a cheery loud-voiced sportsman with\\na rather red face but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that\\nwas distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality “extraordinary business this monsieur poirot can’t make head or\\ntail of it seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters and\\nthat this miss marvell’s had ’em too what does it all mean ”\\npoirot handed him the copy of _society gossip_ “first _milord_ i would ask you if these facts are substantially\\ncorrect ”\\nthe peer took it his face darkened with anger as he read “damned nonsense ” he spluttered “there’s never been any romantic\\nstory attaching to the diamond it came from india originally i\\nbelieve i never heard of all this chinese god stuff ”\\n“still the stone _is_ known as ‘the star of the east ’”\\n“well what if it is ” he demanded wrathfully poirot smiled a little but made no direct reply “what i would\\nask you to do _milord_ is to place yourself in my hands if you\\ndo so unreservedly i have great hopes of averting the catastrophe ”\\n“then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat\\ntales ”\\n“will you do as i ask you ”\\n“of course i will but——”\\n“_bien _ then permit that i ask you a few questions this affair\\nof yardly chase is it as you say all fixed up between you and\\nmr rolf ”\\n“oh he told you about it did he no there’s nothing settled ”\\nhe hesitated the brick-red colour of his face deepening “might\\nas well get the thing straight i’ve made rather an ass of myself\\nin many ways monsieur poirot—and i’m head over ears in debt—but\\ni want to pull up i’m fond of the kids and i want to straighten\\nthings up and be able to live on at the old place gregory rolf\\nis offering me big money—enough to set me on my feet again i don’t\\nwant to do it—i hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting\\nround the chase—but i may have to unless——” he broke off poirot eyed him keenly “you have then another string to your\\nbow permit that i make a guess it is to sell the star of the\\neast ”\\nlord yardly nodded “that’s it it’s been in the family for some\\ngenerations but it’s not entailed still it’s not the easiest\\nthing in the world to find a purchaser hoffberg the hatton garden\\nman is on the look-out for a likely customer but he’ll have to\\nfind one soon or it’s a washout ”\\n“one more question _permettez_—lady yardly which plan does she\\napprove ”\\n“oh she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel you know what\\nwomen are she’s all for this film stunt ”\\n“i comprehend ” said poirot he remained a moment or so in thought then rose briskly to his feet “you return to yardly chase at once _bien _ say no word to anyone—to _anyone_ mind—but expect us there\\nthis evening we will arrive shortly after five ”\\n“all right but i don’t see——”\\n“_ça n’a pas d’importance_ ” said poirot kindly “you will that i\\npreserve for you your diamond _n’est-ce pas_ ”\\n“yes but——”\\n“then do as i say ”\\na sadly bewildered nobleman left the room • • • • • • •\\nit was half-past five when we arrived at yardly chase and followed\\nthe dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of\\nblazing logs a pretty picture met our eyes: lady yardly and her\\ntwo children the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two\\nfair ones lord yardly stood near smiling down on them “monsieur poirot and captain hastings ” announced the butler lady yardly looked up with a start her husband came forward\\nuncertainly his eyes seeking instruction from poirot the little\\nman was equal to the occasion “all my excuses it is that i investigate still this affair of miss\\nmarvell’s she comes to you on friday does she not i make a\\nlittle tour first to make sure that all is secure also i wanted\\nto ask of lady yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on\\nthe letters she received ”\\nlady yardly shook her head regretfully “i’m afraid i don’t it is\\nstupid of me but you see i never dreamt of taking them\\nseriously ”\\n“you’ll stay the night ” said lord yardly “oh _milord_ i fear to incommode you we have left our bags at\\nthe inn ”\\n“that’s all right ” lord yardly had his cue “we’ll send down for\\nthem no no—no trouble i assure you ”\\npoirot permitted himself to be persuaded and sitting down by lady\\nyardly began to make friends with the children in a short time\\nthey were all romping together and had dragged me into the game “_vous êtes bonne mère_ ” said poirot with a gallant little bow as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse lady yardly smoothed her ruffled hair “i adore them ” she said with a little catch in her voice “and they you—with reason ” poirot bowed again a dressing-gong sounded and we rose to go up to our rooms at that\\nmoment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he\\nhanded to lord yardly the latter tore it open with a brief word\\nof apology as he read it he stiffened visibly with an ejaculation he handed it to his wife then he glanced at\\nmy friend “just a minute monsieur poirot i feel you ought to know about\\nthis it’s from hoffberg he thinks he’s found a customer for the\\ndiamond—an american sailing for the states to-morrow they’re\\nsending down a chap to-night to vet the stone by jove though if\\nthis goes through——” words failed him lady yardly had turned away she still held the telegram in her\\nhand “i wish you wouldn’t sell it george ” she said in a low voice “it’s been in the family so long ” she waited as though for a\\nreply but when none came her face hardened she shrugged her\\nshoulders “i must go and dress i suppose i had better display\\n‘the goods ’” she turned to poirot with a slight grimace “it’s\\none of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed george\\nhas always promised to have the stones reset for me but it’s never\\nbeen done ” she left the room half an hour later we three were assembled in the great drawing-room\\nawaiting the lady it was already a few minutes past the dinner\\nhour suddenly there was a low rustle and lady yardly appeared framed\\nin the doorway a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire she stood there\\nwith one hand just touching the necklace “behold the sacrifice ” she said gaily her ill-humour seemed to\\nhave vanished “wait while i turn the big light on and you shall\\nfeast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england ”\\nthe switches were just outside the door as she stretched out her\\nhand to them the incredible thing happened suddenly without any\\nwarning every light was extinguished the door banged and from\\nthe other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream “my god ” cried lord yardly “that was maude’s voice what has\\nhappened ”\\nwe rushed blindly for the door cannoning into each other in the\\ndarkness it was some minutes before we could find it what a sight\\nmet our eyes lady yardly lay senseless on the marble floor a\\ncrimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been\\nwrenched from her neck as we bent over her uncertain for the moment whether she were dead\\nor alive her eyelids opened “the chinaman ” she whispered painfully “the chinaman—the side\\ndoor ”\\nlord yardly sprang up with an oath i accompanied him my heart\\nbeating wildly the chinaman again the side door in question was\\na small one in the angle of the wall not more than a dozen yards\\nfrom the scene of the tragedy as we reached it i gave a cry there just short of the threshold lay the glittering necklace evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight i\\nswooped joyously down on it then i uttered another cry which lord\\nyardly echoed for in the middle of the necklace was a great gap the star of the east was missing “that settles it ” i breathed “these were no ordinary thieves this one stone was all they wanted ”\\n“but how did the fellow get in ”\\n“through this door ”\\n“but it’s always locked ”\\ni shook my head “it’s not locked now see ” i pulled it open as\\ni spoke as i did so something fluttered to the ground i picked it up it\\nwas a piece of silk and the embroidery was unmistakable it had\\nbeen torn from a chinaman’s robe “in his haste it caught in the door ” i explained “come hurry he cannot have gone far as yet ”\\nbut in vain we hunted and searched in the pitch darkness of the\\nnight the thief had found it easy to make his getaway we returned\\nreluctantly and lord yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste\\nto fetch the police lady yardly aptly ministered to by poirot who is as good as a\\nwoman in these matters was sufficiently recovered to be able to\\ntell her story “i was just going to turn on the other light ” she said “when a\\nman sprang on me from behind he tore my necklace from my neck with\\nsuch force that i fell headlong to the floor as i fell i saw him\\ndisappearing through the side door then i realized by the pig-tail\\nand the embroidered robe that he was a chinaman ” she stopped with\\na shudder the butler reappeared he spoke in a low voice to lord yardly “a gentleman from mr hoffberg’s m’lord he says you expect him ”\\n“good heavens ” cried the distracted nobleman “i must see him i\\nsuppose no not here mullings in the library ”\\ni drew poirot aside “look here my dear fellow hadn’t we better get back to london ”\\n“you think so hastings why ”\\n“well”—i coughed delicately—“things haven’t gone very well have\\nthey i mean you tell lord yardly to place himself in your hands\\nand all will be well—and then the diamond vanishes from under your\\nvery nose ”\\n“true ” said poirot rather crestfallen “it was not one of my most\\nstriking triumphs ”\\nthis way of describing events almost caused me to smile but i\\nstuck to my guns “so having—pardon the expression—rather made a mess of things don’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately ”\\n“and the dinner the without doubt excellent dinner that the\\n_chef_ of lord yardly has prepared ”\\n“oh what’s dinner ” i said impatiently poirot held up his hands in horror “_mon dieu _ it is that in this country you treat the affairs\\ngastronomic with a criminal indifference ”\\n“there’s another reason why we should get back to london as soon\\nas possible ” i continued “what is that my friend ”\\n“the other diamond ” i said lowering my voice “miss marvell’s ”\\n“_eh bien_ what of it ”\\n“don’t you see ” his unusual obtuseness annoyed me what had\\nhappened to his usually keen wits “they’ve got one now they’ll\\ngo for the other ”\\n“_tiens _” cried poirot stepping back a pace and regarding me with\\nadmiration “but your brain marches to a marvel my friend figure\\nto yourself that for the moment i had not thought of that but\\nthere is plenty of time the full of the moon it is not until\\nfriday ”\\ni shook my head dubiously the full of the moon theory left me\\nentirely cold i had my way with poirot however and we departed\\nimmediately leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology\\nfor lord yardly my idea was to go at once to the _magnificent_ and relate to miss\\nmarvell what had occurred but poirot vetoed the plan and insisted\\nthat the morning would be time enough i gave in rather grudgingly in the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out i\\nbegan to suspect that having made a mistake to start with he was\\nsingularly loath to proceed with the case in answer to my\\npersuasions he pointed out with admirable common sense that as\\nthe details of the affair at yardly chase were already in the\\nmorning papers the rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell\\nthem i gave way unwillingly events proved my forebodings to be justified about two o’clock the telephone rang poirot answered it he listened for some\\nmoments then with a brief “_bien j’y serai_” he rang off and\\nturned to me “what do you think _mon ami_ ” he looked half ashamed half\\nexcited “the diamond of miss marvell it has been stolen ”\\n“what ” i cried springing up “and what about the ‘full of the\\nmoon’ now ” poirot hung his head “when did this happen ”\\n“this morning i understand ”\\ni shook my head sadly “if only you had listened to me you see i\\nwas right ”\\n“it appears so _mon ami_ ” said poirot cautiously “appearances\\nare deceptive they say but it certainly appears so ”\\nas we hurried in a taxi to the _magnificent_ i puzzled out the\\ntrue inwardness of the scheme “that ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever the whole point of it\\nwas to get us to concentrate on the friday and so be off our guard\\nbeforehand it is a pity you did not realize that ”\\n“_ma foi _” said poirot airily his nonchalance quite restored\\nafter its brief eclipse “one cannot think of everything ”\\ni felt sorry for him he did so hate failure of any kind “cheer up ” i said consolingly “better luck next time ”\\nat the _magnificent_ we were ushered at once into the manager’s\\noffice gregory rolf was there with two men from scotland yard a\\npale-faced clerk sat opposite them rolf nodded to us as we entered “we’re getting to the bottom of it ” he said “but it’s almost\\nunbelievable how the guy had the nerve i can’t think ”\\na very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts mr rolf had gone\\nout of the hotel at 11 15 at 11 30 a gentleman so like him in\\nappearance as to pass muster entered the hotel and demanded the\\njewel-case from the safe deposit he duly signed the receipt remarking carelessly as he did so: “looks a bit different from my\\nordinary one but i hurt my hand getting out of the taxi ” the\\nclerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference rolf laughed and said: “well don’t run me in as a crook this time anyway i’ve been getting threatening letters from a chinaman and\\nthe worst of it is i look rather like a chink myself—it’s something\\nabout the eyes ”\\n“i looked at him ” said the clerk who was telling us this “and i\\nsaw at once what he meant the eyes slanted up at the corners like\\nan oriental’s i’d never noticed it before ”\\n“darn it all man ” roared gregory rolf leaning forward “do you\\nnotice it now ”\\nthe man looked up at him and started “no sir ” he said “i can’t say i do ” and indeed there was\\nnothing even remotely oriental about the frank brown eyes that\\nlooked into ours the scotland yard man grunted “bold customer thought the eyes\\nmight be noticed and took the bull by the horns to disarm\\nsuspicion he must have watched you out of the hotel sir and\\nnipped in as soon as you were well away ”\\n“what about the jewel-case ” i asked “it was found in a corridor of the hotel only one thing had been\\ntaken—‘the western star ’”\\nwe stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre so unreal poirot hopped briskly to his feet “i have not been of much use i fear ” he said regretfully “is it permitted to see madame ”\\n“i guess she’s prostrated with the shock ” explained rolf “then perhaps i might have a few words alone with you monsieur ”\\n“certainly ”\\nin about five minutes poirot reappeared “now my friend ” he said gaily “to a post office i have to send\\na telegram ”\\n“who to ”\\n“lord yardly ” he discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm\\nthrough mine “come come _mon ami_ i know all that you feel\\nabout this miserable business i have not distinguished myself you in my place might have distinguished yourself _bien _ all\\nis admitted let us forget it and have lunch ”\\nit was about four o’clock when we entered poirot’s rooms a figure\\nrose from a chair by the window it was lord yardly he looked\\nhaggard and distraught “i got your wire and came up at once look here i’ve been round\\nto hoffberg and they know nothing about that man of theirs last\\nnight or the wire either do you think that——”\\npoirot held up his hand “my excuses i sent that wire and hired the gentleman in question ”\\n“_you_—but why what ” the nobleman spluttered impotently “my little idea was to bring things to a head ” explained poirot\\nplacidly “bring things to a head oh my god ” cried lord yardly “and the ruse succeeded ” said poirot cheerfully “therefore _milord_ i have much pleasure in returning you—this ” with a\\ndramatic gesture he produced a glittering object it was a great\\ndiamond “the star of the east ” gasped lord yardly “but i don’t\\nunderstand——”\\n“no ” said poirot “it makes no matter believe me it was necessary\\nfor the diamond to be stolen i promised you that it should be\\npreserved to you and i have kept my word you must permit me to\\nkeep my little secret convey i beg of you the assurances of my\\ndeepest respect to lady yardly and tell her how pleased i am to\\nbe able to restore her jewel to her what _beau temps_ is it not good day _milord_ ”\\nand smiling and talking the amazing little man conducted the\\nbewildered nobleman to the door he returned gently rubbing his\\nhands “poirot ” i said “am i quite demented ”\\n“no _mon ami_ but you are as always in a mental fog ”\\n“how did you get the diamond ”\\n“from mr rolf ”\\n“rolf ”\\n“_mais oui _ the warning letters the chinaman the article in\\n_society gossip_ all sprang from the ingenious brain of mr rolf the two diamonds supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah they\\ndid not exist there was only _one_ diamond my friend originally\\nin the yardly collection for three years it has been in the\\npossession of mr rolf he stole it this morning with the assistance\\nof a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye ah i must\\nsee him on the film he is indeed an artist _celui-là_ “but why should he steal his own diamond ” i asked puzzled “for many reasons to begin with lady yardly was getting restive ”\\n“lady yardly ”\\n“you comprehend she was left much alone in california her husband\\nwas amusing himself elsewhere mr rolf was handsome he had an\\nair about him of romance but _au fond_ he is very business-like _ce monsieur_ he made love to lady yardly and then he blackmailed\\nher i taxed the lady with the truth the other night and she\\nadmitted it she swore that she had only been indiscreet and i\\nbelieve her but undoubtedly rolf had letters of hers that could\\nbe twisted to bear a different interpretation terrified by the\\nthreat of a divorce and the prospect of being separated from her\\nchildren she agreed to all he wished she had no money of her own and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for\\nthe real stone the coincidence of the date of the appearance of\\n‘the western star’ struck me at once all goes well lord yardly\\nprepares to range himself—to settle down and then comes the menace\\nof the possible sale of the diamond the substitution will be\\ndiscovered without doubt she writes off frantically to gregory\\nrolf who has just arrived in england he soothes her by promising\\nto arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery in this way he\\nwill quiet the lady who might conceivably tell all to her husband an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all he will have\\n£50 000 insurance money (aha you had forgotten that ) and he will\\nstill have the diamond at this point i put my finger in the pie the arrival of a diamond expert is announced lady yardly as i\\nfelt sure she would immediately arranges a robbery—and does it\\nvery well too but hercule poirot he sees nothing but facts what\\nhappens in actuality the lady switches off the light bangs the\\ndoor throws the necklace down the passage and screams she has\\nalready wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs——”\\n“but we saw the necklace round her neck ” i objected “i demand pardon my friend her hand concealed the part of it\\nwhere the gap would have shown to place a piece of silk in the\\ndoor beforehand is child’s play of course as soon as rolf read\\nof the robbery he arranged his own little comedy and very well\\nhe played it ”\\n“what did you say to him ” i asked with lively curiosity “i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all that i\\nwas empowered to recover the jewel and that if it were not\\nimmediately handed over proceedings would be taken also a few more\\nlittle lies which occurred to me he was as wax in my hands ”\\ni pondered the matter “it seems a little unfair on mary marvell she has lost her diamond\\nthrough no fault of her own ”\\n“bah ” said poirot brutally “she has a magnificent advertisement that is all she cares for that one now the other she is\\ndifferent _bonne mère très femme _”\\n“yes ” i said doubtfully hardly sharing poirot’s views on\\nfemininity “i suppose it was rolf who sent her the duplicate\\nletters ”\\n“_pas du tout_ ” said poirot briskly “she came by the advice of\\nmary cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma then she heard that\\nmary marvell whom she knew to be her enemy had been here and\\nshe changed her mind jumping at a pretext that _you_ my friend offered her a very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_\\ntold her of the letters not she you she jumped at the chance your\\nwords offered ”\\n“i don’t believe it ” i cried stung “_si si mon ami_ it is a pity that you study not the psychology she told you that the letters were destroyed oh la la _never_\\ndoes a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it not even if it\\nwould be more prudent to do so ”\\n“it’s all very well ” i said my anger rising “but you’ve made a\\nperfect fool of me from beginning to end no it’s all very well\\nto try and explain it away afterwards there really is a limit ”\\n“but you were so enjoying yourself my friend i had not the heart\\nto shatter your illusions ”\\n“it’s no good you’ve gone a bit too far this time ”\\n“_mon dieu _ but how you enrage yourself for nothing _mon ami_ ”\\n“i’m fed up ” i went out banging the door poirot had made an\\nabsolute laughing-stock of me i decided that he needed a sharp\\nlesson i would let some time elapse before i forgave him he had\\nencouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself ii\\nthe tragedy at marsdon manor\\ni had been called away from town for a few days and on my return\\nfound poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise “_a la bonne heure_ hastings i feared you would not have returned\\nin time to accompany me ”\\n“you are called away on a case then ”\\n“yes though i am bound to admit that on the face of it the\\naffair does not seem promising the northern union insurance\\ncompany have asked me to investigate the death of a mr maltravers\\nwho a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum\\nof fifty thousand pounds ”\\n“yes ” i said much interested “there was of course the usual suicide clause in the policy in\\nthe event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums\\nwould be forfeited mr maltravers was duly examined by the\\ncompany’s own doctor and although he was a man slightly past the\\nprime of life was passed as being in quite sound health however on wednesday last—the day before yesterday—the body of mr maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in essex marsdon\\nmanor and the cause of his death is described as some kind of\\ninternal hæmorrhage that in itself would be nothing remarkable but sinister rumours as to mr maltravers’ financial position have\\nbeen in the air of late and the northern union have ascertained\\nbeyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon\\nthe verge of bankruptcy now that alters matters considerably maltravers had a beautiful young wife and it is suggested that he\\ngot together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying\\nthe premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit and then\\ncommitted suicide such a thing is not uncommon in any case my\\nfriend alfred wright who is a director of the northern union has\\nasked me to investigate the facts of the case but as i told him i am not very hopeful of success if the cause of the death had\\nbeen heart failure i should have been more sanguine heart failure\\nmay always be translated as the inability of the local g p to\\ndiscover what his patient really did die of but a hæmorrhage seems\\nfairly definite still we can but make some necessary inquiries five minutes to pack your bag hastings and we will take a taxi\\nto liverpool street ”\\nabout an hour later we alighted from a great eastern train at the\\nlittle station of marsdon leigh inquiries at the station yielded\\nthe information that marsdon manor was about a mile distant poirot\\ndecided to walk and we betook ourselves along the main street “what is our plan of campaign ” i asked “first i will call upon the doctor i have ascertained that there\\nis only one doctor in marsdon leigh dr ralph bernard ah here\\nwe are at his house ”\\nthe house in question was a kind of superior cottage standing back\\na little from the road a brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s\\nname we passed up the path and rang the bell we proved to be fortunate in our call it was the doctor’s\\nconsulting hour and for the moment there were no patients waiting\\nfor him dr bernard was an elderly man high-shouldered and\\nstooping with a pleasant vagueness of manner poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit adding that insurance companies were bound to investigate fully in\\na case of this kind “of course of course ” said dr bernard vaguely “i suppose as\\nhe was such a rich man his life was insured for a big sum ”\\n“you consider him a rich man doctor ”\\nthe doctor looked rather surprised “was he not he kept two cars you know and marsdon manor is a\\npretty big place to keep up although i believe he bought it very\\ncheap ”\\n“i understand that he had had considerable losses of late ” said\\npoirot watching the doctor narrowly the latter however merely shook his head sadly “is that so indeed it is fortunate for his wife then that there\\nis this life insurance a very beautiful and charming young\\ncreature but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe a mass of\\nnerves poor thing i have tried to spare her all i can but of\\ncourse the shock was bound to be considerable ”\\n“you had been attending mr maltravers recently ”\\n“my dear sir i never attended him ”\\n“what ”\\n“i understand mr maltravers was a christian scientist—or something\\nof that kind ”\\n“but you examined the body ”\\n“certainly i was fetched by one of the under-gardeners ”\\n“and the cause of death was clear ”\\n“absolutely there was blood on the lips but most of the bleeding\\nmust have been internal ”\\n“was he still lying where he had been found ”\\n“yes the body had not been touched he was lying at the edge of\\na small plantation he had evidently been out shooting rooks a\\nsmall rook rifle lay beside him the hæmorrhage must have occurred\\nquite suddenly gastric ulcer without a doubt ”\\n“no question of his having been shot eh ”\\n“my dear sir ”\\n“i demand pardon ” said poirot humbly “but if my memory is not\\nat fault in the case of a recent murder the doctor first gave a\\nverdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable\\npointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head ”\\n“you will not find any bullet wounds on the body of mr maltravers ”\\nsaid dr bernard dryly “now gentlemen if there is nothing\\nfurther——”\\nwe took the hint “good morning and many thanks to you doctor for so kindly\\nanswering our questions by the way you saw no need for an\\nautopsy ”\\n“certainly not ” the doctor became quite apoplectic “the cause of\\ndeath was clear and in my profession we see no need to distress\\nunduly the relatives of a dead patient ”\\nand turning the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces “and what do you think of dr bernard hastings ” inquired poirot as we proceeded on our way to the manor “rather an old ass ”\\n“exactly your judgments of character are always profound my\\nfriend ”\\ni glanced at him uneasily but he seemed perfectly serious a\\ntwinkle however came into his eye and he added slyly:\\n“that is to say when there is no question of a beautiful woman ”\\ni looked at him coldly on our arrival at the manor-house the door was opened to us by a\\nmiddle-aged parlourmaid poirot handed her his card and a letter\\nfrom the insurance company for mrs maltravers she showed us into\\na small morning-room and retired to tell her mistress about ten\\nminutes elapsed and then the door opened and a slender figure in\\nwidow’s weeds stood upon the threshold “monsieur poirot ” she faltered “madame ” poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards\\nher “i cannot tell you how i regret to derange you in this way but what will you _les affaires_—they know no mercy ”\\nmrs maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair her eyes were\\nred with weeping but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal\\nher extraordinary beauty she was about twenty-seven or eight and\\nvery fair with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth “it is something about my husband’s insurance is it but must i\\nbe bothered _now_—so soon ”\\n“courage my dear madame courage you see your late husband\\ninsured his life for rather a large sum and in such a case the\\ncompany always has to satisfy itself as to a few details they have\\nempowered me to act for them you can rest assured that i will do\\nall in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you will you recount to me briefly the sad events of wednesday ”\\n“i was changing for tea when my maid came up—one of the gardeners\\nhad just run to the house he had found——”\\nher voice trailed away poirot pressed her hand sympathetically “i comprehend enough you had seen your husband earlier in the\\nafternoon ”\\n“not since lunch i had walked down to the village for some stamps and i believe he was out pottering round the grounds ”\\n“shooting rooks eh ”\\n“yes he usually took his little rook rifle with him and i heard\\none or two shots in the distance ”\\n“where is this little rook rifle now ”\\n“in the hall i think ”\\nshe led the way out of the room and found and handed the little\\nweapon to poirot who examined it cursorily “two shots fired i see ” he observed as he handed it back “and\\nnow madame if i might see——”\\nhe paused delicately “the servant shall take you ” she murmured averting her head the parlourmaid summoned led poirot upstairs i remained with\\nthe lovely and unfortunate woman it was hard to know whether to\\nspeak or remain silent i essayed one or two general reflections\\nto which she responded absently and in a very few minutes poirot\\nrejoined us “i thank you for all your courtesy madame i do not think you need\\nbe troubled any further with this matter by the way do you know\\nanything of your husband’s financial position ”\\nshe shook her head “nothing whatever i am very stupid over business things ”\\n“i see then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided\\nto insure his life he had not done so previously i understand ”\\n“well we had only been married a little over a year but as to\\nwhy he insured his life it was because he had absolutely made up\\nhis mind that he would not live long he had a strong premonition\\nof his own death i gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already and that he knew that another one would prove fatal i tried to\\ndispel these gloomy fears of his but without avail alas he was\\nonly too right ”\\ntears in her eyes she bade us a dignified farewell poirot made\\na characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together “_eh bien_ that is that back to london my friend there appears\\nto be no mouse in this mouse-hole and yet——”\\n“yet what ”\\n“a slight discrepancy that is all you noticed it you did not still life is full of discrepancies and assuredly the man cannot\\nhave taken his own life—there is no poison that would fill his\\nmouth with blood no no i must resign myself to the fact that\\nall here is clear and above-board—but who is this ”\\na tall young man was striding up the drive towards us he passed\\nus without making any sign but i noted that he was not ill-looking with a lean deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic\\nclime a gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a\\nminute in his task and poirot ran quickly up to him “tell me i pray you who is that gentleman do you know him ”\\n“i don’t remember his name sir though i did hear it he was\\nstaying down here last week for a night tuesday it was ”\\n“quick _mon ami_ let us follow him ”\\nwe hastened up the drive after the retreating figure a glimpse of\\na black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house and\\nour quarry swerved and we after him so that we were witnesses of\\nthe meeting mrs maltravers almost staggered where she stood and her face\\nblanched noticeably “you ” she gasped “i thought you were on the sea—on your way to\\neast africa ”\\n“i got some news from my lawyers that detained me ” explained the\\nyoung man “my old uncle in scotland died unexpectedly and left me\\nsome money under the circumstances i thought it better to cancel\\nmy passage then i saw this bad news in the paper and i came down\\nto see if there was anything i could do you’ll want some one to\\nlook after things for you a bit perhaps ”\\nat that moment they became aware of our presence poirot stepped\\nforward and with many apologies explained that he had left his\\nstick in the hall rather reluctantly it seemed to me mrs maltravers made the necessary introduction “monsieur poirot captain black ”\\na few minutes’ chat ensued in the course of which poirot elicited\\nthe fact that captain black was putting up at the anchor inn the\\nmissing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising) poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew we returned to the village at a great pace and poirot made a bee\\nline for the anchor inn “here we establish ourselves until our friend the captain returns ”\\nhe explained “you notice that i emphasized the point that we were\\nreturning to london by the first train possibly you thought i\\nmeant it but no—you observed mrs maltravers’ face when she caught\\nsight of this young black she was clearly taken aback and he—_eh\\nbien_ he was very devoted did you not think so and he was here\\non tuesday night—the day before mr maltravers died we must\\ninvestigate the doings of captain black hastings ”\\nin about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to\\nthe room we had engaged “i have been telling captain black of the mission which brings us\\nhere ” he explained “you can understand _monsieur le capitaine_ that i am anxious to arrive at mr maltravers’ state of mind\\nimmediately before his death and that at the same time i do not\\nwish to distress mrs maltravers unduly by asking her painful\\nquestions now you were here just before the occurrence and can\\ngive us equally valuable information ”\\n“i’ll do anything i can to help you i’m sure ” replied the young\\nsoldier; “but i’m afraid i didn’t notice anything out of the\\nordinary you see although maltravers was an old friend of my\\npeople’s i didn’t know him very well myself ”\\n“you came down—when ”\\n“tuesday afternoon i went up to town early wednesday morning as\\nmy boat sailed from tilbury about twelve o’clock but some news i\\ngot made me alter my plans as i dare say you heard me explain to\\nmrs maltravers ”\\n“you were returning to east africa i understand ”\\n“yes i’ve been out there ever since the war—a great country ”\\n“exactly now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night ”\\n“oh i don’t know the usual odd topics maltravers asked after my\\npeople and then we discussed the question of german reparations and then mrs maltravers asked a lot of questions about east\\nafrica and i told them one or two yarns that’s about all i\\nthink ”\\n“thank you ”\\npoirot was silent for a moment then he said gently: “with your\\npermission i should like to try a little experiment you have told\\nus all that your conscious self knows i want now to question your\\nsubconscious self ”\\n“psychoanalysis what ” said black with visible alarm “oh no ” said poirot reassuringly “you see it is like this i\\ngive you a word you answer with another and so on any word the\\nfirst one you think of shall we begin ”\\n“all right ” said black slowly but he looked uneasy “note down the words please hastings ” said poirot then he took\\nfrom his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table\\nbeside him “we will commence day ”\\nthere was a moment’s pause and then black replied:\\n“_night_ ”\\nas poirot proceeded his answers came quicker “name ” said poirot “_place_ ”\\n“bernard ”\\n“_shaw_ ”\\n“tuesday ”\\n“_dinner_ ”\\n“journey ”\\n“_ship_ ”\\n“country ”\\n“_uganda_ ”\\n“story ”\\n“_lions_ ”\\n“rook rifle ”\\n“_farm_ ”\\n“shot ”\\n“_suicide_ ”\\n“elephant ”\\n“_tusks_ ”\\n“money ”\\n“_lawyers_ ”\\n“thank you captain black perhaps you could spare me a few minutes\\nin about half an hour’s time ”\\n“certainly ” the young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped\\nhis brow as he got up “and now hastings ” said poirot smiling at me as the door closed\\nbehind him “you see it all do you not ”\\n“i don’t know what you mean ”\\n“does that list of words tell you nothing ”\\ni scrutinized it but was forced to shake my head “i will assist you to begin with black answered well within the\\nnormal time limit with no pauses so we can take it that he\\nhimself has no guilty knowledge to conceal ‘day’ to ‘night’ and\\n‘place’ to ‘name’ are normal associations i began work with\\n‘bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come\\nacross him at all evidently he had not after our recent\\nconversation he gave ‘dinner’ to my ‘tuesday ’ but ‘journey’ and\\n‘country’ were answered by ‘ship’ and ‘uganda ’ showing clearly\\nthat it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not\\nthe one which brought him down here ‘story’ recalls to him one of\\nthe ‘lion’ stories he told at dinner i proceed to ‘rook rifle’\\nand he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘farm ’ when i\\nsay ‘shot ’ he answers at once ‘suicide ’ the association seems\\nclear a man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm\\nsomewhere remember too that his mind is still on the stories he\\ntold at dinner and i think you will agree that i shall not be far\\nfrom the truth if i recall captain black and ask him to repeat the\\nparticular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on\\ntuesday evening ”\\nblack was straightforward enough over the matter “yes i did tell them that story now that i come to think of it chap shot himself on a farm out there did it with a rook rifle\\nthrough the roof of the mouth bullet lodged in the brain doctors\\nwere no end puzzled over it—there was nothing to show except a\\nlittle blood on the lips but what——”\\n“what has it got to do with mr maltravers you did not know i\\nsee that he was found with a rook rifle by his side ”\\n“you mean my story suggested to him—oh but that is awful ”\\n“do not distress yourself—it would have been one way or another well i must get on the telephone to london ”\\npoirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire and came back\\nthoughtful he went off by himself in the afternoon and it was\\nnot till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off\\nno longer but must break the news to the young widow my sympathy\\nhad already gone out to her unreservedly to be left penniless and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to\\nassure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear i\\ncherished a secret hope however that young black might prove\\ncapable of consoling her after her first grief had passed he\\nevidently admired her enormously our interview with the lady was painful she refused vehemently to\\nbelieve the facts that poirot advanced and when she was at last\\nconvinced broke down into bitter weeping an examination of the\\nbody turned our suspicions into certainty poirot was very sorry\\nfor the poor lady but after all he was employed by the insurance\\ncompany and what could he do as he was preparing to leave he said\\ngently to mrs maltravers:\\n“madame you of all people should know that there are no dead ”\\n“what do you mean ” she faltered her eyes growing wide “have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances you are\\nmediumistic you know ”\\n“i have been told so but you do not believe in spiritualism surely ”\\n“madame i have seen some strange things you know that they say\\nin the village that this house is haunted ”\\nshe nodded and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that\\ndinner was ready “won’t you just stay and have something to eat ”\\nwe accepted gratefully and i felt that our presence could not but\\nhelp distract her a little from her own griefs we had just finished our soup when there was a scream outside the\\ndoor and the sound of breaking crockery we jumped up the\\nparlourmaid appeared her hand to her heart “it was a man—standing in the passage ”\\npoirot rushed out returning quickly “there is no one there ”\\n“isn’t there sir ” said the parlourmaid weakly “oh it did give\\nme a start ”\\n“but why ”\\nshe dropped her voice to a whisper “i thought—i thought it was the master—it looked like ’im ”\\ni saw mrs maltravers give a terrified start and my mind flew to\\nthe old superstition that a suicide cannot rest she thought of it\\ntoo i am sure for a minute later she caught poirot’s arm with\\na scream “didn’t you hear that those three taps on the window that’s how\\n_he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house ”\\n“the ivy ” i cried “it was the ivy against the pane ”\\nbut a sort of terror was gaining on us all the parlourmaid was\\nobviously unstrung and when the meal was over mrs maltravers\\nbesought poirot not to go at once she was clearly terrified to be\\nleft alone we sat in the little morning-room the wind was getting\\nup and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion twice the door\\nof the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened and each\\ntime she clung to me with a terrified gasp “ah but this door it is bewitched ” cried\\npoirot angrily at last he got up and shut it once more then\\nturned the key in the lock “i shall lock it so ”\\n“don’t do that ” she gasped “if it should come open now——”\\nand even as she spoke the impossible happened the locked door\\nslowly swung open i could not see into the passage from where i\\nsat but she and poirot were facing it she gave one long shriek\\nas she turned to him “you saw him—there in the passage ” she cried he was staring down at her with a puzzled face then shook his\\nhead “i saw him—my husband—you must have seen him too ”\\n“madame i saw nothing you are not well—unstrung——”\\n“i am perfectly well i——oh god ”\\nsuddenly without any warning the lights quivered and went out out of the darkness came three loud raps i could hear mrs maltravers moaning and then—i saw the man i had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us gleaming with a faint ghostly light there was blood on his lips and he held his right hand out pointing suddenly a brilliant\\nlight seemed to proceed from it it passed over poirot and me and\\nfell on mrs maltravers i saw her white terrified face and\\nsomething else “my god poirot ” i cried “look at her hand her right hand it’s\\nall red ”\\nher own eyes fell on it and she collapsed in a heap on the floor “blood ” she cried hysterically “yes it’s blood i killed him i did it he was showing me and then i put my hand on the trigger\\nand pressed save me from him—save me he’s come back ”\\nher voice died away in a gurgle “lights ” said poirot briskly the lights went on as if by magic “that’s it ” he continued “you heard hastings and you everett oh by the way this is mr everett rather a fine member of the\\ntheatrical profession i ’phoned to him this afternoon his make-up\\nis good isn’t it quite like the dead man and with a pocket torch\\nand the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression i shouldn’t touch her right hand if i were you hastings red paint\\nmarks so when the lights went out i clasped her hand you see by\\nthe way we mustn’t miss our train inspector japp is outside the\\nwindow a bad night—but he has been able to while away the time by\\ntapping on the window every now and then ”\\n“you see ” continued poirot as we walked briskly through the wind\\nand rain “there was a little discrepancy the doctor seemed to\\nthink the deceased was a christian scientist and who could have\\ngiven him that impression but mrs maltravers but to us she\\nrepresented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about\\nhis own health again why was she so taken aback by the reappearance\\nof young black and lastly although i know that convention decrees\\nthat a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her\\nhusband i do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids you did\\nnot observe them hastings no as i always tell you you see\\nnothing ”\\n“well there it was there were the two possibilities did black’s\\nstory suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to mr maltravers or did his other listener the wife see an equally\\ningenious method of committing murder i inclined to the latter\\nview to shoot himself in the way indicated he would probably have\\nhad to pull the trigger with his toe—or at least so i imagine now if maltravers had been found with one boot off we should\\nalmost certainly have heard of it from some one an odd detail like\\nthat would have been remembered “no as i say i inclined to the view that it was a case of murder not suicide but i realized that i had not a shadow of proof in\\nsupport of my theory hence the elaborate little comedy you saw\\nplayed to-night ”\\n“even now i don’t quite see all the details of the crime ” i said “let us start from the beginning here is a shrewd and scheming\\nwoman who knowing of her husband’s financial _débâcle_ and tired\\nof the elderly mate she has only married for his money induces\\nhim to insure his life for a large sum and then seeks for the\\nmeans to accomplish her purpose an accident gives her that—the\\nyoung soldier’s strange story the next afternoon when _monsieur\\nle capitaine_ as she thinks is on the high seas she and her\\nhusband are strolling round the grounds ‘what a curious story that\\nwas last night ’ she observes ‘could a man shoot himself in such\\na way do show me if it is possible ’ the poor fool—he shows her he places the end of the rifle in his mouth she stoops down and\\nputs her finger on the trigger laughing up at him ‘and now sir ’\\nshe says saucily ‘supposing i pull the trigger ’\\n“and then—and then hastings—she pulls it ”\\n iii\\nthe case of the missing will\\nthe problem presented to us by miss violet marsh made rather a\\npleasant change from our usual routine work poirot had received\\na brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an\\nappointment and he had replied asking her to call upon him at\\neleven o’clock the following day she arrived punctually—a tall handsome young woman plainly but\\nneatly dressed with an assured and business-like manner clearly\\na young woman who meant to get on in the world i am not a great\\nadmirer of the so-called new woman myself and in spite of her\\ngood looks i was not particularly prepossessed in her favour “my business is of a somewhat unusual nature monsieur poirot ”\\nshe began after she had accepted a chair “i had better begin at\\nthe beginning and tell you the whole story ”\\n“if you please mademoiselle ”\\n“i am an orphan my father was one of two brothers sons of a small\\nyeoman farmer in devonshire the farm was a poor one and the elder\\nbrother andrew emigrated to australia where he did very well\\nindeed and by means of successful speculation in land became a\\nvery rich man the younger brother roger (my father) had no\\nleanings towards the agricultural life he managed to educate\\nhimself a little and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm he married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor\\nartist my father died when i was six years old when i was\\nfourteen my mother followed him to the grave my only living\\nrelation then was my uncle andrew who had recently returned from\\naustralia and bought a small place crabtree manor in his native\\ncounty he was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child took\\nme to live with him and treated me in every way as though i was\\nhis own daughter “crabtree manor in spite of its name is really only an old\\nfarmhouse farming was in my uncle’s blood and he was intensely\\ninterested in various modern farming experiments although kindness\\nitself to me he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as\\nto the up-bringing of women himself a man of little or no\\neducation though possessing remarkable shrewdness he placed\\nlittle value on what he called ‘book knowledge ’ he was especially\\nopposed to the education of women in his opinion girls should\\nlearn practical housework and dairy-work be useful about the home and have as little to do with book learning as possible he proposed\\nto bring me up on these lines to my bitter disappointment and\\nannoyance i rebelled frankly i knew that i possessed a good\\nbrain and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties my uncle\\nand i had many bitter arguments on the subject for though much\\nattached to each other we were both self-willed i was lucky\\nenough to win a scholarship and up to a certain point was\\nsuccessful in getting my own way the crisis arose when i resolved\\nto go to girton i had a little money of my own left me by my\\nmother and i was quite determined to make the best use of the\\ngifts god had given me i had one long final argument with my\\nuncle he put the facts plainly before me he had no other\\nrelations and he had intended me to be his sole heiress as i have\\ntold you he was a very rich man if i persisted in these\\n‘new-fangled notions’ of mine however i need look for nothing\\nfrom him i remained polite but firm i should always be deeply\\nattached to him i told him but i must lead my own life we parted\\non that note ‘you fancy your brains my girl ’ were his last\\nwords ‘i’ve no book learning but for all that i’ll pit mine\\nagainst yours any day we’ll see what we shall see ’\\n“that was nine years ago i have stayed with him for a week-end\\noccasionally and our relations were perfectly amicable though\\nhis views remained unaltered he never referred to my having\\nmatriculated nor to my b sc for the last three years his health\\nhad been failing and a month ago he died “i am now coming to the point of my visit my uncle left a most\\nextraordinary will by its terms crabtree manor and its contents\\nare to be at my disposal for a year from his death—‘during which\\ntime my clever niece may prove her wits ’ the actual words run at\\nthe end of that period ‘my wits having proved better than hers ’\\nthe house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various\\ncharitable institutions ”\\n“that is a little hard on you mademoiselle seeing that you were\\nmr marsh’s only blood relation ”\\n“i do not look on it in that way uncle andrew warned me fairly and i chose my own path since i would not fall in with his wishes he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased ”\\n“was the will drawn up by a lawyer ”\\n“no; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the\\nman and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle ”\\n“there might be a possibility of upsetting such a will ”\\n“i would not even attempt to do such a thing ”\\n“you regard it then as a sporting challenge on the part of your\\nuncle ”\\n“that is exactly how i look upon it ”\\n“it bears that interpretation certainly ” said poirot thoughtfully “somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed\\neither a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will and has\\ngiven you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it ”\\n“exactly monsieur poirot; and i am paying you the compliment of\\nassuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine ”\\n“eh eh but that is very charming of you my grey cells are at\\nyour disposal you have made no search yourself ”\\n“only a cursory one; but i have too much respect for my uncle’s\\nundoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one ”\\n“have you the will or a copy of it with you ”\\nmiss marsh handed a document across the table poirot ran through\\nit nodding to himself “made three years ago dated march 25; and the time is given\\nalso—11 a m —that is very suggestive it narrows the field of\\nsearch assuredly it is another will we have to seek for a will\\nmade even half-an-hour later would upset this _eh bien_ mademoiselle it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have\\npresented to me here i shall have all the pleasure in the world\\nin solving it for you granted that your uncle was a man of ability his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of hercule poirot’s ”\\n(really poirot’s vanity is blatant )\\n“fortunately i have nothing of moment on hand at the minute hastings and i will go down to crabtree manor to-night the man\\nand wife who attended on your uncle are still there i presume ”\\n“yes their name is baker ”\\n • • • • • • •\\nthe following morning saw us started on the hunt proper we had\\narrived late the night before mr and mrs baker having received\\na telegram from miss marsh were expecting us they were a pleasant\\ncouple the man gnarled and pink-cheeked like a shrivelled pippin and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true devonshire calm tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken apple pie and devonshire cream we had now disposed of an excellent\\nbreakfast and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been\\nthe late mr marsh’s study and living-room a roll-top desk stuffed\\nwith papers all neatly docketed stood against the wall and a\\nbig leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s\\nconstant resting-place a big chintz-covered settee ran along the\\nopposite wall and the deep low window seats were covered with the\\nsame faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern “_eh bien mon ami_ ” said poirot lighting one of his tiny\\ncigarettes “we must map out our plan of campaign already i have\\nmade a rough survey of the house but i am of opinion that any clue\\nwill be found in this room we shall have to go through the\\ndocuments in the desk with meticulous care naturally i do not\\nexpect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some\\napparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place but first we must have a little information ring the bell i pray\\nof you ”\\ni did so while we were waiting for it to be answered poirot\\nwalked up and down looking about him approvingly “a man of method this mr marsh see how neatly the packets of\\npapers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory\\nlabel—so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see\\nwith what precision the china within is arranged it rejoices the\\nheart nothing here offends the eye——”\\nhe came to an abrupt pause as his eye was caught by the key of\\nthe desk itself to which a dirty envelope was affixed poirot\\nfrowned at it and withdrew it from the lock on it were scrawled\\nthe words: “key of roll top desk ” in a crabbed handwriting quite\\nunlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys “an alien note ” said poirot frowning “i could swear that here\\nwe have no longer the personality of mr marsh but who else has\\nbeen in the house only miss marsh and she if i mistake not is\\nalso a young lady of method and order ”\\nbaker came in answer to the bell “will you fetch madame your wife and answer a few questions ”\\nbaker departed and in a few moments returned with mrs baker wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face in a few clear words poirot set forth the object of his mission the bakers were immediately sympathetic “us don’t want to see miss violet done out of what’s hers ” declared\\nthe woman “cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all ”\\npoirot proceeded with his questions yes mr and mrs baker\\nremembered perfectly witnessing the will baker had previously been\\nsent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms “two ” said poirot sharply “yes sir for safety like i suppose in case he should spoil\\none—and sure enough so he did do us had signed one——”\\n“what time of day was that ”\\nbaker scratched his head but his wife was quicker “why to be sure i’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven don’t ee remember it had all boiled over on the stove when us got\\nback to kitchen ”\\n“and afterwards ”\\n“’twould be about an hour later us had to go in again ‘i’ve made\\na mistake ’ says old master ‘had to tear the whole thing up i’ll\\ntrouble you to sign again ’ and us did and afterwards master give\\nus a tidy sum of money each ‘i’ve left you nothing in my will ’\\nsays he ‘but each year i live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg\\nwhen i’m gone’; and sure enough so he did ”\\npoirot reflected “after you had signed the second time what did mr marsh do do\\nyou know ”\\n“went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books ”\\nthat did not seem very promising poirot tried another tack he\\nheld out the key of the desk “is that your master’s writing ”\\ni may have imagined it but i fancied that a moment or two elapsed\\nbefore baker replied: “yes sir it is ”\\n“he’s lying ” i thought “but why ”\\n“has your master let the house —have there been any strangers in\\nit during the last three years ”\\n“no sir ”\\n“no visitors ”\\n“only miss violet ”\\n“no strangers of any kind been inside this room ”\\n“no sir ”\\n“you forget the workmen jim ” his wife reminded him “workmen ” poirot wheeled round on her “what workmen ”\\nthe woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen\\nhad been in the house to do certain repairs she was quite vague\\nas to what the repairs were her view seemed to be that the whole\\nthing was a fad of her master’s and quite unnecessary part of the\\ntime the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done\\nthere she could not say as her master had not let either of them\\ninto the room whilst the work was in progress unfortunately they\\ncould not remember the name of the firm employed beyond the fact\\nthat it was a plymouth one “we progress hastings ” said poirot rubbing his hands as the\\nbakers left the room “clearly he made a second will and then had\\nworkmen from plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place instead\\nof wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls we will\\ngo to plymouth ”\\nwith a little trouble we were able to get the information we\\nwanted after one or two essays we found the firm employed by mr marsh their employees had all been with them many years and it was easy\\nto find the two men who had worked under mr marsh’s orders they\\nremembered the job perfectly amongst various other minor jobs they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace made a cavity beneath and so cut the brick that it was impossible\\nto see the join by pressing on the second brick from the end the\\nwhole thing was raised it had been quite a complicated piece of\\nwork and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it our\\ninformant was a man called coghan a big gaunt man with a grizzled\\nmoustache he seemed an intelligent fellow we returned to crabtree manor in high spirits and locking the\\nstudy door proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into\\neffect it was impossible to see any sign on the bricks but when\\nwe pressed in the manner indicated a deep cavity was at once\\ndisclosed eagerly poirot plunged in his hand suddenly his face fell from\\ncomplacent elation to consternation all he held was a charred\\nfragment of stiff paper but for it the cavity was empty “_sacré _” cried poirot angrily “some one has been before us ”\\nwe examined the scrap of paper anxiously clearly it was a fragment\\nof what we sought a portion of baker’s signature remained but no\\nindication of what the terms of the will had been poirot sat back on his heels his expression would have been\\ncomical if we had not been so overcome “i understand it not ” he growled “who destroyed this and what\\nwas their object ”\\n“the bakers ” i suggested “_pourquoi _ neither will makes any provision for them and they\\nare more likely to be kept on with miss marsh than if the place\\nbecame the property of a hospital how could it be to anyone’s\\nadvantage to destroy the will the hospitals benefit—yes; but one\\ncannot suspect institutions ”\\n“perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself ”\\ni suggested poirot rose to his feet dusting his knees with his usual care “that may be ” he admitted “one of your more sensible observations hastings well we can do no more here we have done all that\\nmortal man can do we have successfully pitted our wits against\\nthe late andrew marsh’s; but unfortunately his niece is no better\\noff for our success ”\\nby driving to the station at once we were just able to catch a\\ntrain to london though not the principal express poirot was sad\\nand dissatisfied for my part i was tired and dozed in a corner suddenly as we were just moving out of taunton poirot uttered a\\npiercing squeal “_vite_ hastings awake and jump but jump i say ”\\nbefore i knew where i was we were standing on the platform bareheaded and minus our valises whilst the train disappeared into\\nthe night i was furious but poirot paid no attention “imbecile that i have been ” he cried “triple imbecile not again\\nwill i vaunt my little grey cells ”\\n“that’s a good job at any rate ” i said grumpily “but what is this\\nall about ”\\nas usual when following out his own ideas poirot paid absolutely\\nno attention to me “the tradesmen’s books—i have left them entirely out of account yes but where where never mind i cannot be mistaken we must\\nreturn at once ”\\neasier said than done we managed to get a slow train to exeter and there poirot hired a car we arrived back at crabtree manor in\\nthe small hours of the morning i pass over the bewilderment of\\nthe bakers when we had at last aroused them paying no attention\\nto anybody poirot strode at once to the study “i have been not a triple imbecile but thirty-six times one my\\nfriend ” he deigned to remark “now behold ”\\ngoing straight to the desk he drew out the key and detached the\\nenvelope from it i stared at him stupidly how could he possibly\\nhope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope with great care\\nhe cut open the envelope laying it out flat then he lighted the\\nfire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the\\nflame in a few minutes faint characters began to appear “look _mon ami_ ” cried poirot in triumph i looked there were just a few lines of faint writing stating\\nbriefly that he left everything to his niece violet marsh it was\\ndated march 25 12 30 p m and witnessed by albert pike confectioner and jessie pike married woman “but is it legal ” i gasped “as far as i know there is no law against writing your will in a\\nblend of disappearing and sympathetic ink the intention of the\\ntestator is clear and the beneficiary is his only living relation but the cleverness of him he foresaw every step that a searcher\\nwould take—that i miserable imbecile took he gets two will-forms makes the servants sign twice then sallies out with his will\\nwritten on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen\\ncontaining his little ink mixture on some excuse he gets the\\nconfectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own\\nsignature then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to\\nhimself if his niece sees through his little ruse she will have\\njustified her choice of life and elaborate education and be\\nthoroughly welcome to his money ”\\n“she didn’t see through it did she ” i said slowly “it seems\\nrather unfair the old man really won ”\\n“but no hastings it is _your_ wits that go astray miss marsh\\nproved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher\\neducation for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands always employ the expert she has amply proved her right to the\\nmoney ”\\ni wonder—i very much wonder—what old andrew marsh would have\\nthought the end\\n'"
