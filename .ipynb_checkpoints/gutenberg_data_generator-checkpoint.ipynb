      "gastritis, helped on by habitual over-indulgence in alcoholic\n",
      "beverages. the symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not,\n",
      "i agree, unlike, but caroline bases her accusation on quite different\n",
      "lines.\n",

      "mind, caroline’s voice came again, with a sharper note in it.\n",
      "“what on earth are you doing out there, james? why don’t you come and\n",
      "get your breakfast?”\n",
      "“just coming, my dear,” i said hastily. “i’ve been hanging up my\n",

      "“you could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.”\n",
      "she was quite right. i could have.\n",

      "which is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does\n",
      "when she is interested or excited over anything.\n",
      "“well?” she demanded.\n",

      "“it wasn’t annie who told me. it was the milkman. he had it from the\n",
      "ferrars’ cook.”\n",
      "as i say, there is no need for caroline to go out to get information.\n",
      "she sits at home, and it comes to her.\n",
      "my sister continued:\n",
      "“what did she die of? heart failure?”\n",
      "“didn’t the milkman tell you that?” i inquired sarcastically.\n",
      "sarcasm is wasted on caroline. she takes it seriously and answers\n",
      "accordingly.\n",
      "“he didn’t know,” she explained.\n",
      "after all, caroline was bound to hear sooner or later. she might as\n",
      "well hear from me.\n",
      "“she died of an overdose of veronal. she’s been taking it lately for\n",
      "sleeplessness. must have taken too much.”\n",
      "“nonsense,” said caroline immediately. “she took it on purpose. don’t\n",
      "tell me!”\n",
      "it is odd how, when you have a secret belief of your own which you do\n",
      "not wish to acknowledge, the voicing of it by some one else will rouse\n",
      "you to a fury of denial. i burst immediately into indignant speech.\n",
      "“there you go again,” i said. “rushing along without rhyme or reason.\n",
      "why on earth should mrs. ferrars wish to commit suicide? a widow,\n",
      "fairly young still, very well off, good health, and nothing to do but\n",
      "enjoy life. it’s absurd.”\n",
      "“not at all. even you must have noticed how different she has been\n",
      "looking lately. it’s been coming on for the last six months. she’s\n",
      "looked positively hag-ridden. and you have just admitted that she\n",
      "hasn’t been able to sleep.”\n",
      "“what is your diagnosis?” i demanded coldly. “an unfortunate love\n",
      "affair, i suppose?”\n",
      "my sister shook her head.\n",
      "“_remorse_,” she said, with great gusto.\n",
      "“remorse?”\n",
      "“yes. you never would believe me when i told you she poisoned her\n",
      "husband. i’m more than ever convinced of it now.”\n",
      "“i don’t think you’re very logical,” i objected. “surely if a woman\n",
      "committed a crime like murder, she’d be sufficiently cold-blooded to\n",
      "enjoy the fruits of it without any weak-minded sentimentality such as\n",
      "repentance.”\n",
      "caroline shook her head.\n",
      "“there probably are women like that—but mrs. ferrars wasn’t one of\n",
      "them. she was a mass of nerves. an overmastering impulse drove her on\n",
      "to get rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply\n",
      "can’t endure suffering of any kind, and there’s no doubt that the wife\n",
      "of a man like ashley ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal——”\n",
      "i nodded.\n",
      "“and ever since she’s been haunted by what she did. i can’t help\n",
      "feeling sorry for her.”\n",

      "alive. now that she has gone where (presumably) paris frocks can no\n",
      "longer be worn, caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions\n",
      "of pity and comprehension.\n",
      "i told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense. i was all the more\n",
      "firm because i secretly agreed with some part, at least, of what she\n",
      "had said. but it is all wrong that caroline should arrive at the truth\n",
      "simply by a kind of inspired guesswork. i wasn’t going to encourage\n",
      "that sort of thing. she will go round the village airing her views, and\n",
      "every one will think that she is doing so on medical data supplied by\n",
      "me. life is very trying.\n",
      "“nonsense,” said caroline, in reply to my strictures. “you’ll see. ten\n",

      "“she didn’t leave a letter of any kind,” i said sharply, and not seeing\n",
      "where the admission was going to land me.\n",
      "“oh!” said caroline. “so you _did_ inquire about that, did you? i\n",
      "believe, james, that in your heart of hearts, you think very much as i\n",
      "do. you’re a precious old humbug.”\n",
      "“one always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration,”\n",

      "of course, ackroyd is not really a country squire. he is an immensely\n",

      "nearly fifty years of age, rubicund of face and genial of manner.\n",
      "he is hand and glove with the vicar, subscribes liberally to parish\n",
      "funds (though rumor has it that he is extremely mean in personal\n",

      "soldiers’ institutes. he is, in fact, the life and soul of our peaceful\n",
      "village of king’s abbot.\n",
      "now when roger ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one, he fell in love with,\n",
      "and married, a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior. her\n",
      "name was paton, and she was a widow with one child. the history of the\n",
      "marriage was short and painful. to put it bluntly, mrs. ackroyd was\n",

      "years after her marriage.\n",
      "in the years that followed, ackroyd showed no disposition to make a\n",
      "second matrimonial adventure. his wife’s child by her first marriage\n",

      "more marked. they were always seen about together, and it was freely\n",
      "conjectured that at the end of her period of mourning, mrs. ferrars\n",
      "would become mrs. roger ackroyd. it was felt, indeed, that there was a\n",
      "certain fitness in the thing. roger ackroyd’s wife had admittedly died\n",
      "of drink. ashley ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his\n",
      "death. it was only fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess\n",
      "should make up to each other for all that they had previously endured\n",
      "at the hands of their former spouses.\n",
      "the ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago, but a halo of\n",
      "gossip has surrounded ackroyd for many years past. all the time that\n",
      "ralph paton was growing up to manhood, a series of lady housekeepers\n",

      "conclusions which lends a touch of greatness to caroline’s maneuvers.\n",
      "miss ganett was breathless and interrogatory.\n",
      "wasn’t it sad about poor dear mrs. ferrars? a lot of people were saying\n",

      "and all this with a sharp beady eye on me to see how i reacted to\n",
      "these suggestions. fortunately long association with caroline has led\n",

      "non-committal remarks.\n",
      "on this occasion i congratulated miss ganett on not joining in\n",

      "done so. miss russell’s account of vague pains was so unconvincing that\n",

      "to pump me on the subject of mrs. ferrars’s death, but i soon saw that\n",
      "there, at least, i had misjudged her. she made a brief reference to the\n",

      "a slave of the drug habit. is there any cure?”\n",
      "one cannot answer a question like that offhand. i gave her a short\n",
      "lecture on the subject, and she listened with close attention. i still\n",

      "she admitted that she had.\n",

      "i told her a good deal about curare, but she seemed to have lost\n",
      "interest once more. she asked me if i had any in my poison cupboard,\n",
      "and when i replied in the negative i fancy i fell in her estimation.\n",

      "in the growing of vegetable marrows.\n",
      "but that is certainly not the sort of information that caroline is\n",

      "mustache of his.”\n",
      "caroline dissented. she said that if the man was a hairdresser, he\n",

      "before such profuse apologies, my anger was forced to melt. after\n",
      "all, the wretched vegetable hadn’t hit me. but i sincerely hoped that\n",
      "throwing large vegetables over walls was not our new friend’s hobby.\n",
      "such a habit could hardly endear him to us as a neighbor.\n",
      "the strange little man seemed to read my thoughts.\n",

      "towards a certain object, may labor and toil to attain a certain kind\n",
      "of leisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns\n",
      "for the old busy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself\n",
      "so glad to leave?”\n",
      "“yes,” i said slowly. “i fancy that that is a common enough occurrence.\n",
      "i myself am perhaps an instance. a year ago i came into a legacy—enough\n",
      "to enable me to realize a dream. i have always wanted to travel, to see\n",
      "the world. well, that was a year ago, as i said, and—i am still here.”\n",
      "my little neighbor nodded.\n",

      "gained, we find that what we miss is the daily toil. and mark you,\n",
      "monsieur, my work was interesting work. the most interesting work there\n",

      "strong within me.\n",

      "very dear to me. figure to yourself that i miss even his stupidity.\n",
      "his _naïveté_, his honest outlook, the pleasure of delighting and\n",
      "surprising him by my superior gifts—all these i miss more than i can\n",
      "tell you.”\n",
      "“he died?” i asked sympathetically.\n",
      "“not so. he lives and flourishes—but on the other side of the world. he\n",

      "“in the argentine,” i said enviously.\n",
      "i have always wanted to go to south america. i sighed, and then\n",

      "i shook my head with a sigh.\n",

      "than foolish—greedy. i risked the substance for the shadow.”\n",
      "“i comprehend,” said mr. porrott. “you speculated?”\n",
      "i nodded mournfully, but in spite of myself i felt secretly\n",
      "entertained. this ridiculous little man was so portentously solemn.\n",
      "“not the porcupine oilfields?” he asked suddenly.\n",
      "i stared.\n",
      "“i thought of them, as a matter of fact, but in the end i plumped for a\n",
      "gold mine in western australia.”\n",
      "my neighbor was regarding me with a strange expression which i could\n",
      "not fathom.\n",
      "“it is fate,” he said at last.\n",
      "“what is fate?” i asked irritably.\n",
      "“that i should live next to a man who seriously considers porcupine\n",
      "oilfields, and also west australian gold mines. tell me, have you also\n",
      "a penchant for auburn hair?”\n",
      "i stared at him open-mouthed, and he burst out laughing.\n",
      "“no, no, it is not the insanity that i suffer from. make your mind\n",
      "easy. it was a foolish question that i put to you there, for, see you,\n",
      "my friend of whom i spoke was a young man, a man who thought all women\n",
      "good, and most of them beautiful. but you are a man of middle age, a\n",
      "doctor, a man who knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this\n",
      "life of ours. well, well, we are neighbors. i beg of you to accept and\n",
      "present to your excellent sister my best marrow.”\n",
      "he stooped, and with a flourish produced an immense specimen of the\n",
      "tribe, which i duly accepted in the spirit in which it was offered.\n",
      "“indeed,” said the little man cheerfully, “this has not been a wasted\n",
      "morning. i have made the acquaintance of a man who in some ways\n",
      "resembles my far-off friend. by the way, i should like to ask you a\n",
      "question. you doubtless know every one in this tiny village. who is the\n",
      "young man with the very dark hair and eyes, and the handsome face. he\n",
      "walks with his head flung back, and an easy smile on his lips?”\n",
      "the description left me in no doubt.\n",
      "“that must be captain ralph paton,” i said slowly.\n",
      "“i have not seen him about here before?”\n",
      "“no, he has not been here for some time. but he is the son—adopted son,\n",
      "rather—of mr. ackroyd of fernly park.”\n",
      "my neighbor made a slight gesture of impatience.\n",
      "“of course, i should have guessed. mr. ackroyd spoke of him many times.”\n",
      "“you know mr. ackroyd?” i said, slightly surprised.\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd knew me in london—when i was at work there. i have asked\n",
      "him to say nothing of my profession down here.”\n",
      "“i see,” i said, rather amused by this patent snobbery, as i thought it.\n",
      "but the little man went on with an almost grandiloquent smirk.\n",
      "“one prefers to remain incognito. i am not anxious for notoriety. i\n",
      "have not even troubled to correct the local version of my name.”\n",

      "“who told you so?” i asked, very much surprised.\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd. about a week ago. he is very pleased about it—has long\n",
      "desired that such a thing should come to pass, or so i understood\n",
      "from him. i even believe that he brought some pressure to bear upon\n",
      "the young man. that is never wise. a young man should marry to please\n",
      "himself—not to please a stepfather from whom he has expectations.”\n",
      "my ideas were completely upset. i could not see ackroyd taking a\n",
      "hairdresser into his confidence, and discussing the marriage of his\n",
      "niece and stepson with him. ackroyd extends a genial patronage to the\n",
      "lower orders, but he has a very great sense of his own dignity. i began\n",
      "to think that porrott couldn’t be a hairdresser after all.\n",
      "to hide my confusion, i said the first thing that came into my head.\n",
      "“what made you notice ralph paton? his good looks?”\n",
      "“no, not that alone—though he is unusually good-looking for an\n",
      "englishman—what your lady novelists would call a greek god. no, there\n",
      "was something about that young man that i did not understand.”\n",
      "he said the last sentence in a musing tone of voice which made an\n",
      "indefinable impression upon me. it was as though he was summing up the\n",
      "boy by the light of some inner knowledge that i did not share. it was\n",
      "that impression that was left with me, for at that moment my sister’s\n",
      "voice called me from the house.\n",
      "i went in. caroline had her hat on, and had evidently just come in from\n",
      "the village. she began without preamble.\n",
      "“i met mr. ackroyd.”\n",
      "“yes?” i said.\n",
      "“i stopped him, of course, but he seemed in a great hurry, and anxious\n",
      "to get away.”\n",
      "i have no doubt but that that was the case. he would feel towards\n",
      "caroline much as he had felt towards miss ganett earlier in the\n",
      "day—perhaps more so. caroline is less easy to shake off.\n",

      "harm with this habit of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately?”\n",
      "“nonsense,” said my sister. “people ought to know things. i consider it\n",
      "my duty to tell them. mr. ackroyd was very grateful to me.”\n",
      "“well?” i said, for there was clearly more to come.\n",

      "understood much in him that puzzled others. he was, to a certain\n",
      "extent, the victim of heredity. he had not inherited his mother’s\n",
      "fatal propensity for drink, but nevertheless he had in him a strain\n",
      "of weakness. as my new friend of this morning had declared, he was\n",
      "extraordinarily handsome. just on six feet, perfectly proportioned,\n",
      "with the easy grace of an athlete, he was dark, like his mother,\n",
      "with a handsome, sunburnt face always ready to break into a smile.\n",
      "ralph paton was of those born to charm easily and without effort. he\n",
      "was self-indulgent and extravagant, with no veneration for anything\n",
      "on earth, but he was lovable nevertheless, and his friends were all\n",
      "devoted to him.\n",
      "could i do anything with the boy? i thought i could.\n",
      "on inquiry at the three boars i found that captain paton had just come\n",

      "my reception, but i need have had no misgivings.\n",
      "“why, it’s sheppard! glad to see you.”\n",

      "i raised my eyebrows.\n",
      "“what’s the place been doing?”\n",

      "“thanks,” i said, “i will.”\n",
      "he pressed the bell, then, coming back, threw himself into a chair.\n",
      "“not to mince matters,” he said gloomily, “i’m in the devil of a mess.\n",
      "in fact, i haven’t the least idea what to do next.”\n",

      "“it’s my confounded stepfather.”\n",
      "“what has he done?”\n",
      "“it isn’t what he’s done yet, but what he’s likely to do.”\n",
      "the bell was answered, and ralph ordered the drinks. when the man had\n",
      "gone again, he sat hunched in the arm-chair, frowning to himself.\n",
      "“is it really—serious?” i asked.\n",
      "he nodded.\n",
      "“i’m fairly up against it this time,” he said soberly.\n",
      "the unusual ring of gravity in his voice told me that he spoke the\n",
      "truth. it took a good deal to make ralph grave.\n",
      "“in fact,” he continued, “i can’t see my way ahead.... i’m damned if i\n",
      "can.”\n",
      "“if i could help——” i suggested diffidently.\n",
      "but he shook his head very decidedly.\n",
      "“good of you, doctor. but i can’t let you in on this. i’ve got to play\n",
      "a lone hand.”\n",

      " dinner at fernly\n",
      "it was just a few minutes before half-past seven when i rang the\n",
      "front door bell of fernly park. the door was opened with admirable\n",
      "promptitude by parker, the butler.\n",
      "the night was such a fine one that i had preferred to come on foot. i\n",
      "stepped into the big square hall and parker relieved me of my overcoat.\n",
      "just then ackroyd’s secretary, a pleasant young fellow by the name of\n",
      "raymond, passed through the hall on his way to ackroyd’s study, his\n",
      "hands full of papers.\n",
      "“good-evening, doctor. coming to dine? or is this a professional call?”\n",
      "the last was in allusion to my black bag, which i had laid down on the\n",
      "oak chest.\n",
      "i explained that i expected a summons to a confinement case at any\n",
      "moment, and so had come out prepared for an emergency call. raymond\n",
      "nodded, and went on his way, calling over his shoulder:—\n",
      "“go into the drawing-room. you know the way. the ladies will be down in\n",
      "a minute. i must just take these papers to mr. ackroyd, and i’ll tell\n",
      "him you’re here.”\n",
      "on raymond’s appearance parker had withdrawn, so i was alone in the\n",
      "hall. i settled my tie, glanced in a large mirror which hung there, and\n",
      "crossed to the door directly facing me, which was, as i knew, the door\n",
      "of the drawing-room.\n",
      "i noticed, just as i was turning the handle, a sound from within—the\n",
      "shutting down of a window, i took it to be. i noted it, i may say,\n",
      "quite mechanically, without attaching any importance to it at the time.\n",
      "i opened the door and walked in. as i did so, i almost collided with\n",
      "miss russell, who was just coming out. we both apologized.\n",
      "for the first time i found myself appraising the housekeeper and\n",
      "thinking what a handsome woman she must once have been—indeed, as far\n",
      "as that goes, still was. her dark hair was unstreaked with gray, and\n",
      "when she had a color, as she had at this minute, the stern quality of\n",
      "her looks was not so apparent.\n",
      "quite subconsciously i wondered whether she had been out, for she was\n",
      "breathing hard, as though she had been running.\n",
      "“i’m afraid i’m a few minutes early,” i said.\n",
      "“oh! i don’t think so. it’s gone half-past seven, dr. sheppard.” she\n",
      "paused a minute before saying, “i—didn’t know you were expected to\n",
      "dinner to-night. mr. ackroyd didn’t mention it.”\n",
      "i received a vague impression that my dining there displeased her in\n",
      "some way, but i couldn’t imagine why.\n",
      "“how’s the knee?” i inquired.\n",
      "“much the same, thank you, doctor. i must be going now. mrs. ackroyd\n",
      "will be down in a moment. i—i only came in here to see if the flowers\n",
      "were all right.”\n",
      "she passed quickly out of the room. i strolled to the window,\n",
      "wondering at her evident desire to justify her presence in the room. as\n",
      "i did so, i saw what, of course, i might have known all the time had\n",
      "i troubled to give my mind to it, namely, that the windows were long\n",
      "french ones opening on the terrace. the sound i had heard, therefore,\n",
      "could not have been that of a window being shut down.\n",
      "quite idly, and more to distract my mind from painful thoughts than for\n",
      "any other reason, i amused myself by trying to guess what could have\n",
      "caused the sound in question.\n",
      "coals on the fire? no, that was not the kind of noise at all. a drawer\n",
      "of the bureau pushed in? no, not that.\n",
      "then my eye was caught by what, i believe, is called a silver table,\n",
      "the lid of which lifts, and through the glass of which you can see the\n",
      "contents. i crossed over to it, studying the things. there were one\n",
      "or two pieces of old silver, a baby shoe belonging to king charles\n",
      "the first, some chinese jade figures, and quite a number of african\n",
      "implements and curios. wanting to examine one of the jade figures more\n",
      "closely, i lifted the lid. it slipped through my fingers and fell.\n",
      "at once i recognized the sound i had heard. it was this same table lid\n",
      "being shut down gently and carefully. i repeated the action once or\n",
      "twice for my own satisfaction. then i lifted the lid to scrutinize the\n",
      "contents more closely.\n",
      "i was still bending over the open silver table when flora ackroyd came\n",
      "into the room.\n",
      "quite a lot of people do not like flora ackroyd, but nobody can help\n",
      "admiring her. and to her friends she can be very charming. the first\n",
      "thing that strikes you about her is her extraordinary fairness. she has\n",
      "the real scandinavian pale gold hair. her eyes are blue—blue as the\n",
      "waters of a norwegian fiord, and her skin is cream and roses. she has\n",
      "square, boyish shoulders and slight hips. and to a jaded medical man it\n",
      "is very refreshing to come across such perfect health.\n",
      "a simple straight-forward english girl—i may be old-fashioned, but i\n",
      "think the genuine article takes a lot of beating.\n",
      "flora joined me by the silver table, and expressed heretical doubts as\n",
      "to king charles i ever having worn the baby shoe.\n",
      "“and anyway,” continued miss flora, “all this making a fuss about\n",
      "things because some one wore or used them seems to me all nonsense.\n",
      "they’re not wearing or using them now. the pen that george eliot wrote\n",
      "_the mill on the floss_ with—that sort of thing—well, it’s only just a\n",
      "pen after all. if you’re really keen on george eliot, why not get _the\n",
      "mill on the floss_ in a cheap edition and read it.”\n",
      "“i suppose you never read such old out-of-date stuff, miss flora?”\n",
      "“you’re wrong, dr. sheppard. i love _the mill on the floss_.”\n",
      "i was rather pleased to hear it. the things young women read nowadays\n",
      "and profess to enjoy positively frighten me.\n",
      "“you haven’t congratulated me yet, dr. sheppard,” said flora. “haven’t\n",
      "you heard?”\n",
      "she held out her left hand. on the third finger of it was an\n",
      "exquisitely set single pearl.\n",
      "“i’m going to marry ralph, you know,” she went on. “uncle is very\n",
      "pleased. it keeps me in the family, you see.”\n",
      "i took both her hands in mine.\n",
      "“my dear,” i said, “i hope you’ll be very happy.”\n",
      "“we’ve been engaged for about a month,” continued flora in her cool\n",
      "voice, “but it was only announced yesterday. uncle is going to do up\n",
      "cross-stones, and give it to us to live in, and we’re going to pretend\n",
      "to farm. really, we shall hunt all the winter, town for the season, and\n",
      "then go yachting. i love the sea. and, of course, i shall take a great\n",
      "interest in the parish affairs, and attend all the mothers’ meetings.”\n",
      "just then mrs. ackroyd rustled in, full of apologies for being late.\n",
      "i am sorry to say i detest mrs. ackroyd. she is all chains and teeth\n",
      "and bones. a most unpleasant woman. she has small pale flinty blue\n",
      "eyes, and however gushing her words may be, those eyes of hers always\n",
      "remain coldly speculative.\n",
      "i went across to her, leaving flora by the window. she gave me a\n",
      "handful of assorted knuckles and rings to squeeze, and began talking\n",
      "volubly.\n",
      "had i heard about flora’s engagement? so suitable in every way. the\n",
      "dear young things had fallen in love at first sight. such a perfect\n",
      "pair, he so dark and she so fair.\n",
      "“i can’t tell you, my dear dr. sheppard, the relief to a mother’s\n",
      "heart.”\n",
      "mrs. ackroyd sighed—a tribute to her mother’s heart, whilst her eyes\n",
      "remained shrewdly observant of me.\n",
      "“i was wondering. you are such an old friend of dear roger’s. we\n",
      "know how much he trusts to your judgment. so difficult for me—in\n",
      "my position, as poor cecil’s widow. but there are so many tiresome\n",
      "things—settlements, you know—all that. i fully believe that roger\n",
      "intends to make settlements upon dear flora, but, as you know, he is\n",
      "just a _leetle_ peculiar about money. very usual, i’ve heard, amongst\n",
      "men who are captains of industry. i wondered, you know, if you could\n",
      "just _sound_ him on the subject? flora is so fond of you. we feel you\n",
      "are quite an old friend, although we have only really known you just\n",
      "over two years.”\n",
      "mrs. ackroyd’s eloquence was cut short as the drawing-room door opened\n",
      "once more. i was pleased at the interruption. i hate interfering in\n",
      "other people’s affairs, and i had not the least intention of tackling\n",
      "ackroyd on the subject of flora’s settlements. in another moment i\n",
      "should have been forced to tell mrs. ackroyd as much.\n",
      "“you know major blunt, don’t you, doctor?”\n",
      "“yes, indeed,” i said.\n",
      "a lot of people know hector blunt—at least by repute. he has shot more\n",
      "wild animals in unlikely places than any man living, i suppose. when\n",
      "you mention him, people say: “blunt—you don’t mean the big game man, do\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "his friendship with ackroyd has always puzzled me a little. the two men\n",
      "are so totally dissimilar. hector blunt is perhaps five years ackroyd’s\n",
      "junior. they made friends early in life, and though their ways have\n",
      "diverged, the friendship still holds. about once in two years blunt\n",
      "spends a fortnight at fernly, and an immense animal’s head, with an\n",
      "amazing number of horns which fixes you with a glazed stare as soon\n",
      "as you come inside the front door, is a permanent reminder of the\n",
      "friendship.\n",
      "blunt had entered the room now with his own peculiar, deliberate, yet\n",
      "soft-footed tread. he is a man of medium height, sturdily and rather\n",
      "stockily built. his face is almost mahogany-colored, and is peculiarly\n",
      "expressionless. he has gray eyes that give the impression of always\n",
      "watching something that is happening very far away. he talks little,\n",
      "and what he does say is said jerkily, as though the words were forced\n",
      "out of him unwillingly.\n",
      "he said now: “how are you, sheppard?” in his usual abrupt fashion, and\n",
      "then stood squarely in front of the fireplace looking over our heads as\n",
      "though he saw something very interesting happening in timbuctoo.\n",
      "“major blunt,” said flora, “i wish you’d tell me about these african\n",
      "things. i’m sure you know what they all are.”\n",
      "i have heard hector blunt described as a woman hater, but i noticed\n",
      "that he joined flora at the silver table with what might be described\n",
      "as alacrity. they bent over it together.\n",
      "i was afraid mrs. ackroyd would begin talking about settlements again,\n",
      "so i made a few hurried remarks about the new sweet pea. i knew there\n",
      "was a new sweet pea because the _daily mail_ had told me so that\n",
      "morning. mrs. ackroyd knows nothing about horticulture, but she is the\n",
      "kind of woman who likes to appear well-informed about the topics of the\n",
      "day, and she, too, reads the _daily mail_. we were able to converse\n",
      "quite intelligently until ackroyd and his secretary joined us, and\n",
      "immediately afterwards parker announced dinner.\n",
      "my place at table was between mrs. ackroyd and flora. blunt was on mrs.\n",
      "ackroyd’s other side, and geoffrey raymond next to him.\n",
      "dinner was not a cheerful affair. ackroyd was visibly preoccupied. he\n",
      "looked wretched, and ate next to nothing. mrs. ackroyd, raymond, and\n",
      "i kept the conversation going. flora seemed affected by her uncle’s\n",
      "depression, and blunt relapsed into his usual taciturnity.\n",
      "immediately after dinner ackroyd slipped his arm through mine and led\n",
      "me off to his study.\n",
      "“once we’ve had coffee, we shan’t be disturbed again,” he explained. “i\n",
      "told raymond to see to it that we shouldn’t be interrupted.”\n",
      "i studied him quietly without appearing to do so. he was clearly under\n",
      "the influence of some strong excitement. for a minute or two he paced\n",
      "up and down the room, then, as parker entered with the coffee tray, he\n",
      "sank into an arm-chair in front of the fire.\n",
      "the study was a comfortable apartment. book-shelves lined one wall of\n",
      "it. the chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather. a large desk\n",
      "stood by the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and\n",
      "filed. on a round table were various magazines and sporting papers.\n",
      "“i’ve had a return of that pain after food lately,” remarked ackroyd\n",
      "casually, as he helped himself to coffee. “you must give me some more\n",
      "of those tablets of yours.”\n",
      "it struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our\n",
      "conference was a medical one. i played up accordingly.\n",
      "“i thought as much. i brought some up with me.”\n",
      "“good man. hand them over now.”\n",
      "“they’re in my bag in the hall. i’ll get them.”\n",
      "ackroyd arrested me.\n",
      "“don’t you trouble. parker will get them. bring in the doctor’s bag,\n",
      "will you, parker?”\n",
      "“very good, sir.”\n",
      "parker withdrew. as i was about to speak, ackroyd threw up his hand.\n",
      "“not yet. wait. don’t you see i’m in such a state of nerves that i can\n",
      "hardly contain myself?”\n",
      "i saw that plainly enough. and i was very uneasy. all sorts of\n",
      "forebodings assailed me.\n",
      "ackroyd spoke again almost immediately.\n",
      "“make certain that window’s closed, will you?” he asked.\n",
      "somewhat surprised, i got up and went to it. it was not a french\n",
      "window, but one of the ordinary sash type. the heavy blue velvet\n",
      "curtains were drawn in front of it, but the window itself was open at\n",
      "the top.\n",
      "parker reëntered the room with my bag while i was still at the window.\n",
      "“that’s all right,” i said, emerging again into the room.\n",
      "“you’ve put the latch across?”\n",
      "“yes, yes. what’s the matter with you, ackroyd?”\n",
      "the door had just closed behind parker, or i would not have put the\n",
      "question.\n",
      "ackroyd waited just a minute before replying.\n",
      "“i’m in hell,” he said slowly, after a minute. “no, don’t bother with\n",
      "those damned tablets. i only said that for parker. servants are so\n",
      "curious. come here and sit down. the door’s closed too, isn’t it?”\n",

      "me. this business of ralph’s is the last straw. but we won’t talk about\n",
      "that now. it’s the other—the other——! i don’t know what to do about it.\n",
      "and i’ve got to make up my mind soon.”\n",
      "“what’s the trouble?”\n",
      "ackroyd remained silent for a minute or two. he seemed curiously averse\n",
      "to begin. when he did speak, the question he asked came as a complete\n",
      "surprise. it was the last thing i expected.\n",
      "“sheppard, you attended ashley ferrars in his last illness, didn’t you?”\n",
      "“yes, i did.”\n",
      "he seemed to find even greater difficulty in framing his next question.\n",
      "“did you never suspect—did it ever enter your head—that—well, that he\n",
      "might have been poisoned?”\n",
      "i was silent for a minute or two. then i made up my mind what to say.\n",
      "roger ackroyd was not caroline.\n",
      "“i’ll tell you the truth,” i said. “at the time i had no suspicion\n",
      "whatever, but since—well, it was mere idle talk on my sister’s part\n",
      "that first put the idea into my head. since then i haven’t been able to\n",
      "get it out again. but, mind you, i’ve no foundation whatever for that\n",
      "suspicion.”\n",
      "“he _was_ poisoned,” said ackroyd.\n",
      "he spoke in a dull heavy voice.\n",
      "“who by?” i asked sharply.\n",
      "“his wife.”\n",
      "“how do you know that?”\n",

      "i waited a minute, and then he went on.\n",
      "“you understand, sheppard, i’m telling you this in confidence. it’s to\n",
      "go no further. i want your advice—i can’t carry the whole weight by\n",
      "myself. as i said just now, i don’t know what to do.”\n",
      "“can you tell me the whole story?” i said. “i’m still in the dark. how\n",
      "did mrs. ferrars come to make this confession to you?”\n",
      "“it’s like this. three months ago i asked mrs. ferrars to marry me.\n",
      "she refused. i asked her again and she consented, but she refused to\n",
      "allow me to make the engagement public until her year of mourning was\n",
      "up. yesterday i called upon her, pointed out that a year and three\n",
      "weeks had now elapsed since her husband’s death, and that there could\n",
      "be no further objection to making the engagement public property. i\n",
      "had noticed that she had been very strange in her manner for some days.\n",
      "now, suddenly, without the least warning, she broke down completely.\n",
      "she—she told me everything. her hatred of her brute of a husband, her\n",
      "growing love for me, and the—the dreadful means she had taken. poison!\n",
      "my god! it was murder in cold blood.”\n",
      "i saw the repulsion, the horror, in ackroyd’s face. so mrs. ferrars\n",
      "must have seen it. ackroyd is not the type of the great lover who can\n",
      "forgive all for love’s sake. he is fundamentally a good citizen. all\n",
      "that was sound and wholesome and law-abiding in him must have turned\n",
      "from her utterly in that moment of revelation.\n",
      "“yes,” he went on, in a low, monotonous voice, “she confessed\n",
      "everything. it seems that there is one person who has known all\n",
      "along—who has been blackmailing her for huge sums. it was the strain of\n",
      "that that drove her nearly mad.”\n",
      "“who was the man?”\n",
      "suddenly before my eyes there arose the picture of ralph paton and mrs.\n",
      "ferrars side by side. their heads so close together. i felt a momentary\n",
      "throb of anxiety. supposing—oh! but surely that was impossible. i\n",
      "remembered the frankness of ralph’s greeting that very afternoon.\n",
      "absurd!\n",
      "“she wouldn’t tell me his name,” said ackroyd slowly. “as a matter of\n",
      "fact, she didn’t actually say that it was a man. but of course——”\n",
      "“of course,” i agreed. “it must have been a man. and you’ve no\n",
      "suspicion at all?”\n",
      "for answer ackroyd groaned and dropped his head into his hands.\n",
      "“it can’t be,” he said. “i’m mad even to think of such a thing. no, i\n",
      "won’t even admit to you the wild suspicion that crossed my mind. i’ll\n",
      "tell you this much, though. something she said made me think that the\n",
      "person in question might be actually among my household—but that can’t\n",
      "be so. i must have misunderstood her.”\n",
      "“what did you say to her?” i asked.\n",
      "“what could i say? she saw, of course, the awful shock it had been to\n",
      "me. and then there was the question, what was my duty in the matter?\n",
      "she had made me, you see, an accessory after the fact. she saw all\n",
      "that, i think, quicker than i did. i was stunned, you know. she asked\n",
      "me for twenty-four hours—made me promise to do nothing till the end\n",
      "of that time. and she steadfastly refused to give me the name of the\n",
      "scoundrel who had been blackmailing her. i suppose she was afraid that\n",
      "i might go straight off and hammer him, and then the fat would have\n",
      "been in the fire as far as she was concerned. she told me that i should\n",
      "hear from her before twenty-four hours had passed. my god! i swear to\n",
      "you, sheppard, that it never entered my head what she meant to do.\n",
      "suicide! and i drove her to it.”\n",
      "“no, no,” i said. “don’t take an exaggerated view of things. the\n",
      "responsibility for her death doesn’t lie at your door.”\n",
      "“the question is, what am i to do now? the poor lady is dead. why rake\n",
      "up past trouble?”\n",
      "“i rather agree with you,” i said.\n",
      "“but there’s another point. how am i to get hold of that scoundrel who\n",
      "drove her to death as surely as if he’d killed her. he knew of the\n",
      "first crime, and he fastened on to it like some obscene vulture. she’s\n",
      "paid the penalty. is he to go scot-free?”\n",
      "“i see,” i said slowly. “you want to hunt him down? it will mean a lot\n",
      "of publicity, you know.”\n",
      "“yes, i’ve thought of that. i’ve zigzagged to and fro in my mind.”\n",
      "“i agree with you that the villain ought to be punished, but the cost\n",
      "has got to be reckoned.”\n",
      "ackroyd rose and walked up and down. presently he sank into the chair\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“look here, sheppard, suppose we leave it like this. if no word comes\n",
      "from her, we’ll let the dead things lie.”\n",
      "“what do you mean by word coming from her?” i asked curiously.\n",
      "“i have the strongest impression that somewhere or somehow she must\n",
      "have left a message for me—before she went. i can’t argue about it, but\n",
      "there it is.”\n",
      "i shook my head.\n",
      "“she left no letter or word of any kind. i asked.”\n",
      "“sheppard, i’m convinced that she did. and more, i’ve a feeling that by\n",
      "deliberately choosing death, she wanted the whole thing to come out, if\n",
      "only to be revenged on the man who drove her to desperation. i believe\n",
      "that if i could have seen her then, she would have told me his name and\n",
      "bid me go for him for all i was worth.”\n",
      "he looked at me.\n",
      "“you don’t believe in impressions?”\n",
      "“oh, yes, i do, in a sense. if, as you put it, word should come from\n",
      "her——”\n",
      "i broke off. the door opened noiselessly and parker entered with a\n",
      "salver on which were some letters.\n",
      "“the evening post, sir,” he said, handing the salver to ackroyd.\n",
      "then he collected the coffee cups and withdrew.\n",
      "my attention, diverted for a moment, came back to ackroyd. he was\n",
      "staring like a man turned to stone at a long blue envelope. the other\n",
      "letters he had let drop to the ground.\n",
      "“_her writing_,” he said in a whisper. “she must have gone out and\n",
      "posted it last night, just before—before——”\n",
      "he ripped open the envelope and drew out a thick enclosure. then he\n",
      "looked up sharply.\n",
      "“you’re sure you shut the window?” he said.\n",
      "“quite sure,” i said, surprised. “why?”\n",
      "“all this evening i’ve had a queer feeling of being watched, spied\n",
      "upon. what’s that——?”\n",
      "he turned sharply. so did i. we both had the impression of hearing the\n",
      "latch of the door give ever so slightly. i went across to it and opened\n",
      "it. there was no one there.\n",
      "“nerves,” murmured ackroyd to himself.\n",
      "he unfolded the thick sheets of paper, and read aloud in a low voice.\n",
      " “_my dear, my very dear roger,—a life calls for a life. i see\n",
      " that—i saw it in your face this afternoon. so i am taking the only\n",
      " road open to me. i leave to you the punishment of the person who\n",
      " has made my life a hell upon earth for the last year. i would not\n",
      " tell you the name this afternoon, but i propose to write it to you\n",
      " now. i have no children or near relations to be spared, so do not\n",
      " fear publicity. if you can, roger, my very dear roger, forgive me\n",
      " the wrong i meant to do you, since when the time came, i could not\n",
      " do it after all...._”\n",
      "ackroyd, his finger on the sheet to turn it over, paused.\n",
      "“sheppard, forgive me, but i must read this alone,” he said unsteadily.\n",
      "“it was meant for my eyes, and my eyes only.”\n",
      "he put the letter in the envelope and laid it on the table.\n",
      "“later, when i am alone.”\n",
      "“no,” i cried impulsively, “read it now.”\n",
      "ackroyd stared at me in some surprise.\n",
      "“i beg your pardon,” i said, reddening. “i do not mean read it aloud to\n",
      "me. but read it through whilst i am still here.”\n",
      "ackroyd shook his head.\n",
      "“no, i’d rather wait.”\n",
      "but for some reason, obscure to myself, i continued to urge him.\n",
      "“at least, read the name of the man,” i said.\n",
      "now ackroyd is essentially pig-headed. the more you urge him to do a\n",
      "thing, the more determined he is not to do it. all my arguments were in\n",
      "vain.\n",
      "the letter had been brought in at twenty minutes to nine. it was just\n",
      "on ten minutes to nine when i left him, the letter still unread. i\n",
      "hesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering\n",
      "if there was anything i had left undone. i could think of nothing. with\n",
      "a shake of the head i passed out and closed the door behind me.\n",
      "i was startled by seeing the figure of parker close at hand. he looked\n",
      "embarrassed, and it occurred to me that he might have been listening at\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "what a fat, smug, oily face the man had, and surely there was something\n",
      "decidedly shifty in his eye.\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd particularly does not want to be disturbed,” i said\n",
      "coldly. “he told me to tell you so.”\n",
      "“quite so, sir. i—i fancied i heard the bell ring.”\n",
      "this was such a palpable untruth that i did not trouble to reply.\n",
      "preceding me to the hall, parker helped me on with my overcoat, and i\n",
      "stepped out into the night. the moon was overcast and everything seemed\n",
      "very dark and still. the village church clock chimed nine o’clock\n",
      "as i passed through the lodge gates. i turned to the left towards\n",
      "the village, and almost cannoned into a man coming in the opposite\n",
      "direction.\n",
      "“this the way to fernly park, mister?” asked the stranger in a hoarse\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "i looked at him. he was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes, and\n",
      "his coat collar turned up. i could see little or nothing of his face,\n",
      "but he seemed a young fellow. the voice was rough and uneducated.\n",
      "“these are the lodge gates here,” i said.\n",
      "“thank you, mister.” he paused, and then added, quite unnecessarily,\n",
      "“i’m a stranger in these parts, you see.”\n",
      "he went on, passing through the gates as i turned to look after him.\n",
      "the odd thing was that his voice reminded me of some one’s voice that i\n",
      "knew, but whose it was i could not think.\n",
      "ten minutes later i was at home once more. caroline was full of\n",
      "curiosity to know why i had returned so early. i had to make up a\n",
      "slightly fictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her, and\n",
      "i had an uneasy feeling that she saw through the transparent device.\n",
      "at ten o’clock i rose, yawned, and suggested bed. caroline acquiesced.\n",
      "it was friday night, and on friday night i wind the clocks. i did it as\n",
      "usual, whilst caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked\n",
      "up the kitchen properly.\n",
      "it was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs. i had just reached\n",
      "the top when the telephone rang in the hall below.\n",
      "“mrs. bates,” said caroline immediately.\n",
      "“i’m afraid so,” i said ruefully.\n",
      "i ran down the stairs and took up the receiver.\n",
      "“what?” i said. “_what?_ certainly, i’ll come at once.”\n",
      "i ran upstairs, caught up my bag, and stuffed a few extra dressings\n",
      "into it.\n",
      "“parker telephoning,” i shouted to caroline, “from fernly. they’ve just\n",
      "found roger ackroyd murdered.”\n",
      " chapter v\n",
      " murder\n",
      "i got out the car in next to no time, and drove rapidly to fernly.\n",
      "jumping out, i pulled the bell impatiently. there was some delay in\n",
      "answering, and i rang again.\n",
      "then i heard the rattle of the chain and parker, his impassivity of\n",
      "countenance quite unmoved, stood in the open doorway.\n",
      "i pushed past him into the hall.\n",
      "“where is he?” i demanded sharply.\n",
      "“i beg your pardon, sir?”\n",
      "“your master. mr. ackroyd. don’t stand there staring at me, man. have\n",
      "you notified the police?”\n",
      "“the police, sir? did you say the police?” parker stared at me as\n",
      "though i were a ghost.\n",
      "“what’s the matter with you, parker? if, as you say, your master has\n",
      "been murdered——”\n",
      "a gasp broke from parker.\n",
      "“the master? murdered? impossible, sir!”\n",
      "it was my turn to stare.\n",
      "“didn’t you telephone to me, not five minutes ago, and tell me that mr.\n",
      "ackroyd had been found murdered?”\n",
      "“me, sir? oh! no indeed, sir. i wouldn’t dream of doing such a thing.”\n",
      "“do you mean to say it’s all a hoax? that there’s nothing the matter\n",
      "with mr. ackroyd?”\n",
      "“excuse me, sir, did the person telephoning use my name?”\n",
      "“i’ll give you the exact words i heard. ‘_is that dr. sheppard? parker,\n",
      "the butler at fernly, speaking. will you please come at once, sir. mr.\n",
      "ackroyd has been murdered._’”\n",
      "parker and i stared at each other blankly.\n",
      "“a very wicked joke to play, sir,” he said at last, in a shocked tone.\n",
      "“fancy saying a thing like that.”\n",
      "“where is mr. ackroyd?” i asked suddenly.\n",
      "“still in the study, i fancy, sir. the ladies have gone to bed, and\n",
      "major blunt and mr. raymond are in the billiard room.”\n",
      "“i think i’ll just look in and see him for a minute,” i said. “i know\n",
      "he didn’t want to be disturbed again, but this odd practical joke has\n",
      "made me uneasy. i’d just like to satisfy myself that he’s all right.”\n",
      "“quite so, sir. it makes me feel quite uneasy myself. if you don’t\n",
      "object to my accompanying you as far as the door, sir——?”\n",
      "“not at all,” i said. “come along.”\n",
      "i passed through the door on the right, parker on my heels, traversed\n",
      "the little lobby where a small flight of stairs led upstairs to\n",
      "ackroyd’s bedroom, and tapped on the study door.\n",
      "there was no answer. i turned the handle, but the door was locked.\n",
      "“allow me, sir,” said parker.\n",
      "very nimbly, for a man of his build, he dropped on one knee and applied\n",
      "his eye to the keyhole.\n",
      "“key is in the lock all right, sir,” he said, rising. “on the inside.\n",
      "mr. ackroyd must have locked himself in and possibly just dropped off\n",
      "to sleep.”\n",
      "i bent down and verified parker’s statement.\n",
      "“it seems all right,” i said, “but, all the same, parker, i’m going\n",
      "to wake your master up. i shouldn’t be satisfied to go home without\n",
      "hearing from his own lips that he’s quite all right.”\n",
      "so saying, i rattled the handle and called out, “ackroyd, ackroyd, just\n",
      "a minute.”\n",
      "but still there was no answer. i glanced over my shoulder.\n",
      "“i don’t want to alarm the household,” i said hesitatingly.\n",
      "parker went across and shut the door from the big hall through which we\n",
      "had come.\n",
      "“i think that will be all right now, sir. the billiard room is at\n",
      "the other side of the house, and so are the kitchen quarters and the\n",
      "ladies’ bedrooms.”\n",
      "i nodded comprehendingly. then i banged once more frantically on the\n",
      "door, and stooping down, fairly bawled through the keyhole:—\n",
      "“ackroyd, ackroyd! it’s sheppard. let me in.”\n",
      "and still—silence. not a sign of life from within the locked room.\n",
      "parker and i glanced at each other.\n",
      "“look here, parker,” i said, “i’m going to break this door in—or\n",
      "rather, we are. i’ll take the responsibility.”\n",
      "“if you say so, sir,” said parker, rather doubtfully.\n",
      "“i do say so. i’m seriously alarmed about mr. ackroyd.”\n",
      "i looked round the small lobby and picked up a heavy oak chair. parker\n",
      "and i held it between us and advanced to the assault. once, twice, and\n",
      "three times we hurled it against the lock. at the third blow it gave,\n",
      "and we staggered into the room.\n",
      "ackroyd was sitting as i had left him in the arm-chair before the fire.\n",
      "his head had fallen sideways, and clearly visible, just below the\n",
      "collar of his coat, was a shining piece of twisted metalwork.\n",
      "parker and i advanced till we stood over the recumbent figure. i heard\n",
      "the butler draw in his breath with a sharp hiss.\n",
      "“stabbed from be’ind,” he murmured. “’orrible!”\n",
      "he wiped his moist brow with his handkerchief, then stretched out a\n",
      "hand gingerly towards the hilt of the dagger.\n",
      "“you mustn’t touch that,” i said sharply. “go at once to the telephone\n",
      "and ring up the police station. inform them of what has happened. then\n",
      "tell mr. raymond and major blunt.”\n",
      "“very good, sir.”\n",
      "parker hurried away, still wiping his perspiring brow.\n",
      "i did what little had to be done. i was careful not to disturb the\n",
      "position of the body, and not to handle the dagger at all. no object\n",
      "was to be attained by moving it. ackroyd had clearly been dead some\n",
      "little time.\n",
      "then i heard young raymond’s voice, horror-stricken and incredulous,\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "“what do you say? oh! impossible! where’s the doctor?”\n",
      "he appeared impetuously in the doorway, then stopped dead, his face\n",
      "very white. a hand put him aside, and hector blunt came past him into\n",
      "the room.\n",
      "“my god!” said raymond from behind him; “it’s true, then.”\n",
      "blunt came straight on till he reached the chair. he bent over the\n",
      "body, and i thought that, like parker, he was going to lay hold of the\n",
      "dagger hilt. i drew him back with one hand.\n",
      "“nothing must be moved,” i explained. “the police must see him exactly\n",
      "as he is now.”\n",
      "blunt nodded in instant comprehension. his face was expressionless as\n",
      "ever, but i thought i detected signs of emotion beneath the stolid\n",
      "mask. geoffrey raymond had joined us now, and stood peering over\n",
      "blunt’s shoulder at the body.\n",
      "“this is terrible,” he said in a low voice.\n",
      "he had regained his composure, but as he took off the pince-nez he\n",
      "habitually wore and polished them i observed that his hand was shaking.\n",
      "“robbery, i suppose,” he said. “how did the fellow get in? through the\n",
      "window? has anything been taken?”\n",
      "he went towards the desk.\n",
      "“you think it’s burglary?” i said slowly.\n",
      "“what else could it be? there’s no question of suicide, i suppose?”\n",
      "“no man could stab himself in such a way,” i said confidently. “it’s\n",
      "murder right enough. but with what motive?”\n",
      "“roger hadn’t an enemy in the world,” said blunt quietly. “must have\n",
      "been burglars. but what was the thief after? nothing seems to be\n",
      "disarranged?”\n",
      "he looked round the room. raymond was still sorting the papers on the\n",
      "desk.\n",
      "“there seems nothing missing, and none of the drawers show signs of\n",
      "having been tampered with,” the secretary observed at last. “it’s very\n",
      "mysterious.”\n",
      "blunt made a slight motion with his head.\n",
      "“there are some letters on the floor here,” he said.\n",
      "i looked down. three or four letters still lay where ackroyd had\n",
      "dropped them earlier in the evening.\n",
      "but the blue envelope containing mrs. ferrars’s letter had disappeared.\n",
      "i half opened my mouth to speak, but at that moment the sound of a bell\n",
      "pealed through the house. there was a confused murmur of voices in the\n",
      "hall, and then parker appeared with our local inspector and a police\n",
      "constable.\n",
      "“good evening, gentlemen,” said the inspector. “i’m terribly sorry for\n",
      "this! a good kind gentleman like mr. ackroyd. the butler says it is\n",
      "murder. no possibility of accident or suicide, doctor?”\n",
      "“none whatever,” i said.\n",
      "“ah! a bad business.”\n",
      "he came and stood over the body.\n",
      "“been moved at all?” he asked sharply.\n",
      "“beyond making certain that life was extinct—an easy matter—i have not\n",
      "disturbed the body in any way.”\n",
      "“ah! and everything points to the murderer having got clear away—for\n",
      "the moment, that is. now then, let me hear all about it. who found the\n",
      "body?”\n",
      "i explained the circumstances carefully.\n",
      "“a telephone message, you say? from the butler?”\n",
      "“a message that i never sent,” declared parker earnestly. “i’ve not\n",
      "been near the telephone the whole evening. the others can bear me out\n",
      "that i haven’t.”\n",
      "“very odd, that. did it sound like parker’s voice, doctor?”\n",
      "“well—i can’t say i noticed. i took it for granted, you see.”\n",
      "“naturally. well, you got up here, broke in the door, and found poor\n",
      "mr. ackroyd like this. how long should you say he had been dead,\n",
      "doctor?”\n",
      "“half an hour at least—perhaps longer,” i said.\n",
      "“the door was locked on the inside, you say? what about the window?”\n",
      "“i myself closed and bolted it earlier in the evening at mr. ackroyd’s\n",
      "request.”\n",
      "the inspector strode across to it and threw back the curtains.\n",
      "“well, it’s open now anyway,” he remarked.\n",
      "true enough, the window was open, the lower sash being raised to its\n",
      "fullest extent.\n",
      "the inspector produced a pocket torch and flashed it along the sill\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "“this is the way he went all right,” he remarked, “_and_ got in. see\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "in the light of the powerful torch, several clearly defined footmarks\n",
      "could be seen. they seemed to be those of shoes with rubber studs\n",
      "in the soles. one particularly clear one pointed inwards, another,\n",
      "slightly overlapping it, pointed outwards.\n",
      "“plain as a pikestaff,” said the inspector. “any valuables missing?”\n",
      "geoffrey raymond shook his head.\n",
      "“not so that we can discover. mr. ackroyd never kept anything of\n",
      "particular value in this room.”\n",
      "“h’m,” said the inspector. “man found an open window. climbed in, saw\n",
      "mr. ackroyd sitting there—maybe he’d fallen asleep. man stabbed him\n",
      "from behind, then lost his nerve and made off. but he’s left his tracks\n",
      "pretty clearly. we ought to get hold of _him_ without much difficulty.\n",
      "no suspicious strangers been hanging about anywhere?”\n",
      "“oh!” i said suddenly.\n",
      "“what is it, doctor?”\n",
      "“i met a man this evening—just as i was turning out of the gate. he\n",
      "asked me the way to fernly park.”\n",
      "“what time would that be?”\n",
      "“just nine o’clock. i heard it chime the hour as i was turning out of\n",
      "the gate.”\n",
      "“can you describe him?”\n",
      "i did so to the best of my ability.\n",
      "the inspector turned to the butler.\n",
      "“any one answering that description come to the front door?”\n",
      "“no, sir. no one has been to the house at all this evening.”\n",
      "“what about the back?”\n",
      "“i don’t think so, sir, but i’ll make inquiries.”\n",
      "he moved towards the door, but the inspector held up a large hand.\n",
      "“no, thanks. i’ll do my own inquiring. but first of all i want to fix\n",
      "the time a little more clearly. when was mr. ackroyd last seen alive?”\n",
      "“probably by me,” i said, “when i left at—let me see—about ten minutes\n",
      "to nine. he told me that he didn’t wish to be disturbed, and i repeated\n",
      "the order to parker.”\n",
      "“just so, sir,” said parker respectfully.\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd was certainly alive at half-past nine,” put in raymond,\n",
      "“for i heard his voice in here talking.”\n",
      "“who was he talking to?”\n",
      "“that i don’t know. of course, at the time i took it for granted that\n",
      "it was dr. sheppard who was with him. i wanted to ask him a question\n",
      "about some papers i was engaged upon, but when i heard the voices i\n",
      "remembered that he had said he wanted to talk to dr. sheppard without\n",
      "being disturbed, and i went away again. but now it seems that the\n",
      "doctor had already left?”\n",
      "i nodded.\n",
      "“i was at home by a quarter-past nine,” i said. “i didn’t go out again\n",
      "until i received the telephone call.”\n",
      "“who could have been with him at half-past nine?” queried the\n",
      "inspector. “it wasn’t you, mr.—er——”\n",
      "“major blunt,” i said.\n",
      "“major hector blunt?” asked the inspector, a respectful tone creeping\n",
      "into his voice.\n",
      "blunt merely jerked his head affirmatively.\n",
      "“i think we’ve seen you down here before, sir,” said the inspector.\n",
      "“i didn’t recognize you for the moment, but you were staying with mr.\n",
      "ackroyd a year ago last may.”\n",
      "“june,” corrected blunt.\n",
      "“just so, june it was. now, as i was saying, it wasn’t you with mr.\n",
      "ackroyd at nine-thirty this evening?”\n",
      "blunt shook his head.\n",
      "“never saw him after dinner,” he volunteered.\n",
      "the inspector turned once more to raymond.\n",
      "“you didn’t overhear any of the conversation going on, did you, sir?”\n",
      "“i did catch just a fragment of it,” said the secretary, “and,\n",
      "supposing as i did that it was dr. sheppard who was with mr. ackroyd,\n",
      "that fragment struck me as distinctly odd. as far as i can remember,\n",
      "the exact words were these. mr. ackroyd was speaking. ‘the calls\n",
      "on my purse have been so frequent of late’—that is what he was\n",
      "saying—‘of late, that i fear it is impossible for me to accede to your\n",
      "request....’ i went away again at once, of course, so did not hear any\n",
      "more. but i rather wondered because dr. sheppard——”\n",
      "“——does not ask for loans for himself or subscriptions for others,” i\n",
      "finished.\n",
      "“a demand for money,” said the inspector musingly. “it may be that here\n",
      "we have a very important clew.” he turned to the butler. “you say,\n",
      "parker, that nobody was admitted by the front door this evening?”\n",
      "“that’s what i say, sir.”\n",
      "“then it seems almost certain that mr. ackroyd himself must have\n",
      "admitted this stranger. but i don’t quite see——”\n",
      "the inspector went into a kind of day-dream for some minutes.\n",
      "“one thing’s clear,” he said at length, rousing himself from his\n",
      "absorption. “mr. ackroyd was alive and well at nine-thirty. that is the\n",
      "last moment at which he is known to have been alive.”\n",
      "parker gave vent to an apologetic cough which brought the inspector’s\n",
      "eyes on him at once.\n",
      "“well?” he said sharply.\n",
      "“if you’ll excuse me, sir, miss flora saw him after that.”\n",
      "“miss flora?”\n",
      "“yes, sir. about a quarter to ten that would be. it was after that that\n",
      "she told me mr. ackroyd wasn’t to be disturbed again to-night.”\n",
      "“did he send her to you with that message?”\n",
      "“not exactly, sir. i was bringing a tray with soda and whisky when miss\n",
      "flora, who was just coming out of this room, stopped me and said her\n",
      "uncle didn’t want to be disturbed.”\n",
      "the inspector looked at the butler with rather closer attention than he\n",
      "had bestowed on him up to now.\n",
      "“you’d already been told that mr. ackroyd didn’t want to be disturbed,\n",
      "hadn’t you?”\n",
      "parker began to stammer. his hands shook.\n",
      "“yes, sir. yes, sir. quite so, sir.”\n",
      "“and yet you were proposing to do so?”\n",
      "“i’d forgotten, sir. at least i mean, i always bring the whisky and\n",
      "soda about that time, sir, and ask if there’s anything more, and i\n",
      "thought—well, i was doing as usual without thinking.”\n",
      "it was at this moment that it began to dawn upon me that parker was\n",
      "most suspiciously flustered. the man was shaking and twitching all over.\n",
      "“h’m,” said the inspector. “i must see miss ackroyd at once. for the\n",
      "moment we’ll leave this room exactly as it is. i can return here after\n",
      "i’ve heard what miss ackroyd has to tell me. i shall just take the\n",
      "precaution of shutting and bolting the window.”\n",
      "this precaution accomplished, he led the way into the hall and we\n",
      "followed him. he paused a moment, as he glanced up at the little\n",
      "staircase, then spoke over his shoulder to the constable.\n",
      "“jones, you’d better stay here. don’t let any one go into that room.”\n",
      "parker interposed deferentially.\n",
      "“if you’ll excuse me, sir. if you were to lock the door into the main\n",
      "hall, nobody could gain access to this part. that staircase leads only\n",
      "to mr. ackroyd’s bedroom and bathroom. there is no communication with\n",
      "the other part of the house. there once was a door through, but mr.\n",
      "ackroyd had it blocked up. he liked to feel that his suite was entirely\n",
      "private.”\n",
      "to make things clear and explain the position, i have appended a rough\n",
      "sketch of the right-hand wing of the house. the small staircase leads,\n",
      "as parker explained, to a big bedroom (made by two being knocked into\n",
      "one) and an adjoining bathroom and lavatory.\n",

      "“it was a rough, uneducated voice, you say?”\n",
      "i agreed, but it occurred to me that the roughness had been of an\n",

      "“do you mind coming into the study with me again, doctor? there are one\n",
      "or two things i want to ask you.”\n",

      "eavesdropping either. what’s all this about blackmail?”\n",
      "“blackmail!” i exclaimed, very much startled.\n",
      "“is it an effort of parker’s imagination? or is there something in it?”\n",

      "wait for a favorable opportunity. you might as well have it now.”\n",

      "have set them down here. the inspector listened keenly, occasionally\n",

      "of his household was involved? household’s rather an elastic term.”\n",
      "“you don’t think that parker himself might be the man we’re after?” i\n",
      "suggested.\n",
      "“it looks very like it. he was obviously listening at the door when\n",
      "you came out. then miss ackroyd came across him later bent on entering\n",
      "the study. say he tried again when she was safely out of the way. he\n",
      "stabbed ackroyd, locked the door on the inside, opened the window, and\n",
      "got out that way, and went round to a side door which he had previously\n",

      "another hour. he’d have had parker in at once, accused him then and\n",
      "there, and there would have been a fine old uproar. remember, ackroyd\n",
      "was a man of choleric temper.”\n",
      "“mightn’t have had time to go on with the letter just then,” suggested\n",
      "the inspector. “we know some one was with him at half-past nine. if\n",
      "that visitor turned up as soon as you left, and after he went, miss\n",

      "exchange. if it was put through from here, i don’t see how any one\n",
      "else but parker could have sent it. depend upon it, he’s our man.\n",
      "but keep it dark—we don’t want to alarm him just yet, till we’ve got\n",
      "all the evidence. i’ll see to it he doesn’t give us the slip. to all\n",
      "appearances we’ll be concentrating on your mysterious stranger.”\n",
      "he rose from where he had been sitting astride the chair belonging to\n",
      "the desk, and crossed over to the still form in the arm-chair.\n",
      "“the weapon ought to give us a clew,” he remarked, looking up. “it’s\n",
      "something quite unique—a curio, i should think, by the look of it.”\n",
      "he bent down, surveying the handle attentively, and i heard him give a\n",
      "grunt of satisfaction. then, very gingerly, he pressed his hands down\n",
      "below the hilt and drew the blade out from the wound. still carrying it\n",
      "so as not to touch the handle, he placed it in a wide china mug which\n",
      "adorned the mantelpiece.\n",
      "“yes,” he said, nodding at it. “quite a work of art. there can’t be\n",
      "many of them about.”\n",
      "it was indeed a beautiful object. a narrow, tapering blade, and a hilt\n",
      "of elaborately intertwined metals of curious and careful workmanship.\n",
      "he touched the blade gingerly with his finger, testing its sharpness,\n",
      "and made an appreciative grimace.\n",
      "“lord, what an edge,” he exclaimed. “a child could drive that into a\n",
      "man—as easy as cutting butter. a dangerous sort of toy to have about.”\n",
      "“may i examine the body properly now?” i asked.\n",
      "he nodded.\n",
      "“go ahead.”\n",
      "i made a thorough examination.\n",
      "“well?” said the inspector, when i had finished.\n",
      "“i’ll spare you the technical language,” i said. “we’ll keep that\n",
      "for the inquest. the blow was delivered by a right-handed man\n",
      "standing behind him, and death must have been instantaneous. by the\n",
      "expression on the dead man’s face, i should say that the blow was quite\n",
      "unexpected. he probably died without knowing who his assailant was.”\n",
      "“butlers can creep about as soft-footed as cats,” said inspector davis.\n",
      "“there’s not going to be much mystery about this crime. take a look at\n",
      "the hilt of that dagger.”\n",
      "i took the look.\n",
      "“i dare say they’re not apparent to you, but i can see them clearly\n",
      "enough.” he lowered his voice. “_fingerprints!_”\n",
      "he stood off a few steps to judge of his effect.\n",
      "“yes,” i said mildly. “i guessed that.”\n",
      "i do not see why i should be supposed to be totally devoid of\n",
      "intelligence. after all, i read detective stories, and the newspapers,\n",
      "and am a man of quite average ability. if there had been toe marks on\n",
      "the dagger handle, now, that would have been quite a different thing. i\n",
      "would then have registered any amount of surprise and awe.\n",
      "i think the inspector was annoyed with me for declining to get\n",
      "thrilled. he picked up the china mug and invited me to accompany him to\n",
      "the billiard room.\n",
      "“i want to see if mr. raymond can tell us anything about this dagger,”\n",
      "he explained.\n",
      "locking the outer door behind us again, we made our way to the billiard\n",
      "room, where we found geoffrey raymond. the inspector held up his\n",
      "exhibit.\n",
      "“ever seen this before, mr. raymond?”\n",
      "“why—i believe—i’m almost sure that is a curio given to mr. ackroyd\n",
      "by major blunt. it comes from morocco—no, tunis. so the crime was\n",
      "committed with that? what an extraordinary thing. it seems almost\n",
      "impossible, and yet there could hardly be two daggers the same. may i\n",
      "fetch major blunt?”\n",
      "without waiting for an answer, he hurried off.\n",
      "“nice young fellow that,” said the inspector. “something honest and\n",
      "ingenuous about him.”\n",
      "i agreed. in the two years that geoffrey raymond has been secretary to\n",
      "ackroyd, i have never seen him ruffled or out of temper. and he has\n",
      "been, i know, a most efficient secretary.\n",
      "in a minute or two raymond returned, accompanied by blunt.\n",
      "“i was right,” said raymond excitedly. “it _is_ the tunisian dagger.”\n",
      "“major blunt hasn’t looked at it yet,” objected the inspector.\n",
      "“saw it the moment i came into the study,” said the quiet man.\n",
      "“you recognized it then?”\n",
      "blunt nodded.\n",
      "“you said nothing about it,” said the inspector suspiciously.\n",
      "“wrong moment,” said blunt. “lot of harm done by blurting out things at\n",
      "the wrong time.”\n",
      "he returned the inspector’s stare placidly enough.\n",
      "the latter grunted at last and turned away. he brought the dagger over\n",
      "to blunt.\n",
      "“you’re quite sure about it, sir. you identify it positively?”\n",
      "“absolutely. no doubt whatever.”\n",
      "“where was this—er—curio usually kept? can you tell me that, sir?”\n",
      "it was the secretary who answered.\n",
      "“in the silver table in the drawing-room.”\n",
      "“what?” i exclaimed.\n",
      "the others looked at me.\n",
      "“yes, doctor?” said the inspector encouragingly.\n",
      "“it’s nothing.”\n",
      "“yes, doctor?” said the inspector again, still more encouragingly.\n",
      "“it’s so trivial,” i explained apologetically. “only that when i\n",
      "arrived last night for dinner i heard the lid of the silver table being\n",
      "shut down in the drawing-room.”\n",
      "i saw profound skepticism and a trace of suspicion on the inspector’s\n",
      "countenance.\n",
      "“how did you know it was the silver table lid?”\n",
      "i was forced to explain in detail—a long, tedious explanation which i\n",
      "would infinitely rather not have had to make.\n",
      "the inspector heard me to the end.\n",
      "“was the dagger in its place when you were looking over the contents?”\n",
      "he asked.\n",
      "“i don’t know,” i said. “i can’t say i remember noticing it—but, of\n",
      "course, it may have been there all the time.”\n",
      "“we’d better get hold of the housekeeper,” remarked the inspector, and\n",
      "pulled the bell.\n",
      "a few minutes later miss russell, summoned by parker, entered the room.\n",
      "“i don’t think i went near the silver table,” she said, when the\n",
      "inspector had posed his question. “i was looking to see that all the\n",
      "flowers were fresh. oh! yes, i remember now. the silver table was\n",
      "open—which it had no business to be, and i shut the lid down as i\n",
      "passed.”\n",
      "she looked at him aggressively.\n",
      "“i see,” said the inspector. “can you tell me if this dagger was in its\n",
      "place then?”\n",
      "miss russell looked at the weapon composedly.\n",
      "“i can’t say, i’m sure,” she replied. “i didn’t stop to look. i knew\n",
      "the family would be down any minute, and i wanted to get away.”\n",
      "“thank you,” said the inspector.\n",
      "there was just a trace of hesitation in his manner, as though he would\n",
      "have liked to question her further, but miss russell clearly accepted\n",
      "the words as a dismissal, and glided from the room.\n",
      "“rather a tartar, i should fancy, eh?” said the inspector, looking\n",
      "after her. “let me see. this silver table is in front of one of the\n",
      "windows, i think you said, doctor?”\n",
      "raymond answered for me.\n",
      "“yes, the left-hand window.”\n",
      "“and the window was open?”\n",
      "“they were both ajar.”\n",
      "“well, i don’t think we need go into the question much further.\n",
      "somebody—i’ll just say somebody—could get that dagger any time he\n",
      "liked, and exactly when he got it doesn’t matter in the least. i’ll be\n",
      "coming up in the morning with the chief constable, mr. raymond. until\n",
      "then, i’ll keep the key of that door. i want colonel melrose to see\n",
      "everything exactly as it is. i happen to know that he’s dining out the\n",
      "other side of the county, and, i believe, staying the night....”\n",
      "we watched the inspector take up the jar.\n",
      "“i shall have to pack this carefully,” he observed. “it’s going to be\n",
      "an important piece of evidence in more ways than one.”\n",
      "a few minutes later as i came out of the billiard room with raymond,\n",
      "the latter gave a low chuckle of amusement.\n",
      "i felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and followed the direction\n",
      "of his eyes. inspector davis seemed to be inviting parker’s opinion of\n",
      "a small pocket diary.\n",
      "“a little obvious,” murmured my companion. “so parker is the suspect,\n",
      "is he? shall we oblige inspector davis with a set of our fingerprints\n",
      "also?”\n",
      "he took two cards from the card tray, wiped them with his silk\n",
      "handkerchief, then handed one to me and took the other himself. then,\n",
      "with a grin, he handed them to the police inspector.\n",
      "“souvenirs,” he said. “no. 1, dr. sheppard; no. 2, my humble self. one\n",
      "from major blunt will be forthcoming in the morning.”\n",
      "youth is very buoyant. even the brutal murder of his friend and\n",
      "employer could not dim geoffrey raymond’s spirits for long. perhaps\n",
      "that is as it should be. i do not know. i have lost the quality of\n",
      "resilience long since myself.\n",
      "it was very late when i got back, and i hoped that caroline would have\n",
      "gone to bed. i might have known better.\n",
      "she had hot cocoa waiting for me, and whilst i drank it, she extracted\n",
      "the whole history of the evening from me. i said nothing of the\n",
      "blackmailing business, but contented myself with giving her the facts\n",
      "of the murder.\n",
      "“the police suspect parker,” i said, as i rose to my feet and prepared\n",
      "to ascend to bed. “there seems a fairly clear case against him.”\n",
      "“parker!” said my sister. “fiddlesticks! that inspector must be a\n",
      "perfect fool. parker indeed! don’t tell me.”\n",
      "with which obscure pronouncement we went up to bed.\n",
      " chapter vii\n",
      " i learn my neighbor’s profession\n",
      "on the following morning i hurried unforgivably over my round. my\n",
      "excuse can be that i had no very serious cases to attend. on my return\n",
      "caroline came into the hall to greet me.\n",
      "“flora ackroyd is here,” she announced in an excited whisper.\n",
      "“what?”\n",
      "i concealed my surprise as best i could.\n",
      "“she’s very anxious to see you. she’s been here half an hour.”\n",
      "caroline led the way into our small sitting-room, and i followed.\n",
      "flora was sitting on the sofa by the window. she was in black and she\n",
      "sat nervously twisting her hands together. i was shocked by the sight\n",
      "of her face. all the color had faded away from it. but when she spoke\n",
      "her manner was as composed and resolute as possible.\n",
      "“dr. sheppard, i have come to ask you to help me.”\n",
      "“of course he’ll help you, my dear,” said caroline.\n",
      "i don’t think flora really wished caroline to be present at the\n",
      "interview. she would, i am sure, have infinitely preferred to speak to\n",
      "me privately. but she also wanted to waste no time, so she made the\n",
      "best of it.\n",
      "“i want you to come to the larches with me.”\n",
      "“the larches?” i queried, surprised.\n",
      "“to see that funny little man?” exclaimed caroline.\n",
      "“yes. you know who he is, don’t you?”\n",
      "“we fancied,” i said, “that he might be a retired hairdresser.”\n",
      "flora’s blue eyes opened very wide.\n",
      "“why, he’s hercule poirot! you know who i mean—the private detective.\n",
      "they say he’s done the most wonderful things—just like detectives do in\n",
      "books. a year ago he retired and came to live down here. uncle knew who\n",
      "he was, but he promised not to tell any one, because m. poirot wanted\n",
      "to live quietly without being bothered by people.”\n",
      "“so that’s who he is,” i said slowly.\n",
      "“you’ve heard of him, of course?”\n",
      "“i’m rather an old fogey, as caroline tells me,” i said, “but i _have_\n",
      "just heard of him.”\n",
      "“extraordinary!” commented caroline.\n",
      "i don’t know what she was referring to—possibly her own failure to\n",
      "discover the truth.\n",
      "“you want to go and see him?” i asked slowly. “now why?”\n",
      "“to get him to investigate this murder, of course,” said caroline\n",
      "sharply. “don’t be so stupid, james.”\n",
      "i was not really being stupid. caroline does not always understand what\n",
      "i am driving at.\n",
      "“you haven’t got confidence in inspector davis?” i went on.\n",
      "“of course she hasn’t,” said caroline. “i haven’t either.”\n",
      "any one would have thought it was caroline’s uncle who had been\n",
      "murdered.\n",
      "“and how do you know he would take up the case?” i asked. “remember he\n",
      "has retired from active work.”\n",
      "“that’s just it,” said flora simply. “i’ve got to persuade him.”\n",
      "“you are sure you are doing wisely?” i asked gravely.\n",
      "“of course she is,” said caroline. “i’ll go with her myself if she\n",
      "likes.”\n",
      "“i’d rather the doctor came with me if you don’t mind, miss sheppard,”\n",
      "said flora.\n",
      "she knows the value of being direct on certain occasions. any hints\n",
      "would certainly have been wasted on caroline.\n",
      "“you see,” she explained, following directness with tact, “dr. sheppard\n",
      "being the doctor, and having found the body, he would be able to give\n",
      "all the details to m. poirot.”\n",
      "“yes,” said caroline grudgingly, “i see that.”\n",
      "i took a turn or two up and down the room.\n",
      "“flora,” i said gravely, “be guided by me. i advise you not to drag\n",
      "this detective into the case.”\n",
      "flora sprang to her feet. the color rushed into her cheeks.\n",
      "“i know why you say that,” she cried. “but it’s exactly for that reason\n",
      "i’m so anxious to go. you’re afraid! but i’m not. i know ralph better\n",
      "than you do.”\n",
      "“ralph,” said caroline. “what has ralph got to do with it?”\n",
      "neither of us heeded her.\n",
      "“ralph may be weak,” continued flora. “he may have done foolish things\n",
      "in the past—wicked things even—but he wouldn’t murder any one.”\n",
      "“no, no,” i exclaimed. “i never thought it of him.”\n",
      "“then why did you go to the three boars last night?” demanded flora,\n",
      "“on your way home—after uncle’s body was found?”\n",
      "i was momentarily silenced. i had hoped that that visit of mine would\n",
      "remain unnoticed.\n",
      "“how did you know about that?” i countered.\n",
      "“i went there this morning,” said flora. “i heard from the servants\n",
      "that ralph was staying there——”\n",
      "i interrupted her.\n",
      "“you had no idea that he was in king’s abbot?”\n",
      "“no. i was astounded. i couldn’t understand it. i went there and asked\n",
      "for him. they told me, what i suppose they told you last night, that\n",
      "he went out at about nine o’clock yesterday evening—and—and never came\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "her eyes met mine defiantly, and as though answering something in my\n",
      "look, she burst out:—\n",
      "“well, why shouldn’t he? he might have gone—anywhere. he may even have\n",
      "gone back to london.”\n",
      "“leaving his luggage behind?” i asked gently.\n",
      "flora stamped her foot.\n",
      "“i don’t care. there must be a simple explanation.”\n",
      "“and that’s why you want to go to hercule poirot? isn’t it better to\n",
      "leave things as they are? the police don’t suspect ralph in the least,\n",
      "remember. they’re working on quite another tack.”\n",
      "“but that’s just _it_,” cried the girl. “they _do_ suspect him. a man\n",
      "from cranchester turned up this morning—inspector raglan, a horrid,\n",
      "weaselly little man. i found he had been to the three boars this\n",
      "morning before me. they told me all about his having been there, and\n",
      "the questions he had asked. he must think ralph did it.”\n",
      "“that’s a change of mind from last night, if so,” i said slowly. “he\n",
      "doesn’t believe in davis’s theory that it was parker then?”\n",
      "“parker indeed,” said my sister, and snorted.\n",
      "flora came forward and laid her hand on my arm.\n",
      "“oh! dr. sheppard, let us go at once to this m. poirot. he will find\n",
      "out the truth.”\n",
      "“my dear flora,” i said gently, laying my hand on hers. “are you quite\n",
      "sure it is the truth we want?”\n",
      "she looked at me, nodding her head gravely.\n",
      "“you’re not sure,” she said. “i am. i know ralph better than you do.”\n",
      "“of course he didn’t do it,” said caroline, who had been keeping silent\n",
      "with great difficulty. “ralph may be extravagant, but he’s a dear boy,\n",
      "and has the nicest manners.”\n",
      "i wanted to tell caroline that large numbers of murderers have had\n",
      "nice manners, but the presence of flora restrained me. since the\n",
      "girl was determined, i was forced to give in to her and we started\n",
      "at once, getting away before my sister was able to fire off any more\n",
      "pronouncements beginning with her favorite words, “of course.”\n",
      "an old woman with an immense breton cap opened the door of the larches\n",
      "to us. m. poirot was at home, it seemed.\n",
      "we were ushered into a little sitting-room arranged with formal\n",
      "precision, and there, after the lapse of a minute or so, my friend of\n",
      "yesterday came to us.\n",
      "“monsieur le docteur,” he said, smiling. “mademoiselle.”\n",
      "he bowed to flora.\n",
      "“perhaps,” i began, “you have heard of the tragedy which occurred last\n",
      "night.”\n",
      "his face grew grave.\n",
      "“but certainly i have heard. it is horrible. i offer mademoiselle all\n",
      "my sympathy. in what way can i serve you?”\n",
      "“miss ackroyd,” i said, “wants you to—to——”\n",
      "“to find the murderer,” said flora in a clear voice.\n",
      "“i see,” said the little man. “but the police will do that, will they\n",
      "not?”\n",
      "“they might make a mistake,” said flora. “they are on their way to make\n",
      "a mistake now, i think. please, m. poirot, won’t you help us? if—if it\n",
      "is a question of money——”\n",
      "poirot held up his hand.\n",
      "“not that, i beg of you, mademoiselle. not that i do not care for\n",
      "money.” his eyes showed a momentary twinkle. “money, it means much to\n",
      "me and always has done. no, if i go into this, you must understand one\n",
      "thing clearly. _i shall go through with it to the end._ the good dog,\n",
      "he does not leave the scent, remember! you may wish that, after all,\n",
      "you had left it to the local police.”\n",
      "“i want the truth,” said flora, looking him straight in the eyes.\n",
      "“all the truth?”\n",
      "“all the truth.”\n",
      "“then i accept,” said the little man quietly. “and i hope you will not\n",
      "regret those words. now, tell me all the circumstances.”\n",
      "“dr. sheppard had better tell you,” said flora. “he knows more than i\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "thus enjoined, i plunged into a careful narrative, embodying all the\n",
      "facts i have previously set down. poirot listened carefully, inserting\n",
      "a question here and there, but for the most part sitting in silence,\n",
      "his eyes on the ceiling.\n",
      "i brought my story to a close with the departure of the inspector and\n",
      "myself from fernly park the previous night.\n",
      "“and now,” said flora, as i finished, “tell him all about ralph.”\n",
      "i hesitated, but her imperious glance drove me on.\n",
      "“you went to this inn—this three boars—last night on your way home?”\n",
      "asked poirot, as i brought my tale to a close. “now exactly why was\n",
      "that?”\n",
      "i paused a moment to choose my words carefully.\n",
      "“i thought some one ought to inform the young man of his uncle’s death.\n",
      "it occurred to me after i had left fernly that possibly no one but\n",
      "myself and mr. ackroyd were aware that he was staying in the village.”\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“quite so. that was your only motive in going there, eh?”\n",
      "“that was my only motive,” i said stiffly.\n",
      "“it was not to—shall we say—reassure yourself about _ce jeune homme_?”\n",
      "“reassure myself?”\n",
      "“i think, m. le docteur, that you know very well what i mean, though\n",
      "you pretend not to do so. i suggest that it would have been a relief\n",
      "to you if you had found that captain paton had been at home all the\n",
      "evening.”\n",
      "“not at all,” i said sharply.\n",
      "the little detective shook his head at me gravely.\n",
      "“you have not the trust in me of miss flora,” he said. “but no matter.\n",

      "circumstances which call for an explanation. i will not hide from you\n",
      "that the matter looks grave. still, it may admit of a perfectly simple\n",
      "explanation.”\n",
      "“that’s just what i keep saying,” cried flora eagerly.\n",
      "poirot touched no more upon that theme. instead he suggested an\n",
      "immediate visit to the local police. he thought it better for flora\n",
      "to return home, and for me to be the one to accompany him there and\n",
      "introduce him to the officer in charge of the case.\n",
      "we carried out this plan forthwith. we found inspector davis outside\n",
      "the police station looking very glum indeed. with him was colonel\n",
      "melrose, the chief constable, and another man whom, from flora’s\n",
      "description of “weaselly,” i had no difficulty in recognizing as\n",
      "inspector raglan from cranchester.\n",
      "i know melrose fairly well, and i introduced poirot to him and\n",
      "explained the situation. the chief constable was clearly vexed, and\n",
      "inspector raglan looked as black as thunder. davis, however, seemed\n",
      "slightly exhilarated by the sight of his superior officer’s annoyance.\n",
      "“the case is going to be plain as a pikestaff,” said raglan. “not the\n",
      "least need for amateurs to come butting in. you’d think any fool would\n",
      "have seen the way things were last night, and then we shouldn’t have\n",
      "lost twelve hours.”\n",
      "he directed a vengeful glance at poor davis, who received it with\n",
      "perfect stolidity.\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd’s family must, of course, do what they see fit,” said\n",
      "colonel melrose. “but we cannot have the official investigation\n",
      "hampered in any way. i know m. poirot’s great reputation, of course,”\n",
      "he added courteously.\n",
      "“the police can’t advertise themselves, worse luck,” said raglan.\n",
      "it was poirot who saved the situation.\n",
      "“it is true that i have retired from the world,” he said. “i never\n",
      "intended to take up a case again. above all things, i have a horror of\n",
      "publicity. i must beg, that in the case of my being able to contribute\n",
      "something to the solution of the mystery, my name may not be mentioned.”\n",
      "inspector raglan’s face lightened a little.\n",
      "“i’ve heard of some very remarkable successes of yours,” observed the\n",
      "colonel, thawing.\n",
      "“i have had much experience,” said poirot quietly. “but most of my\n",
      "successes have been obtained by the aid of the police. i admire\n",
      "enormously your english police. if inspector raglan permits me to\n",
      "assist him, i shall be both honored and flattered.”\n",
      "the inspector’s countenance became still more gracious.\n",
      "colonel melrose drew me aside.\n",
      "“from all i hear, this little fellow’s done some really remarkable\n",
      "things,” he murmured. “we’re naturally anxious not to have to call in\n",
      "scotland yard. raglan seems very sure of himself, but i’m not quite\n",
      "certain that i agree with him. you see, i—er—know the parties concerned\n",
      "better than he does. this fellow doesn’t seem out after kudos, does he?\n",
      "would work in with us unobtrusively, eh?”\n",
      "“to the greater glory of inspector raglan,” i said solemnly.\n",
      "“well, well,” said colonel melrose breezily in a louder voice, “we must\n",
      "put you wise to the latest developments, m. poirot.”\n",
      "“i thank you,” said poirot. “my friend, dr. sheppard, said something of\n",
      "the butler being suspected?”\n",
      "“that’s all bunkum,” said raglan instantly. “these high-class servants\n",
      "get in such a funk that they act suspiciously for nothing at all.”\n",
      "“the fingerprints?” i hinted.\n",
      "“nothing like parker’s.” he gave a faint smile, and added: “and yours\n",
      "and mr. raymond’s don’t fit either, doctor.”\n",
      "“what about those of captain ralph paton?” asked poirot quietly.\n",
      "i felt a secret admiration for the way he took the bull by the horns. i\n",
      "saw a look of respect creep into the inspector’s eye.\n",
      "“i see you don’t let the grass grow under your feet, mr. poirot. it\n",
      "will be a pleasure to work with you, i’m sure. we’re going to take that\n",
      "young gentleman’s fingerprints as soon as we can lay hands upon him.”\n",
      "“i can’t help thinking you’re mistaken, inspector,” said colonel\n",
      "melrose warmly. “i’ve known ralph paton from a boy upward. he’d never\n",
      "stoop to murder.”\n",
      "“maybe not,” said the inspector tonelessly.\n",
      "“what have you got against him?” i asked.\n",
      "“went out just on nine o’clock last night. was seen in neighborhood of\n",
      "fernly park somewhere about nine-thirty. not been seen since. believed\n",
      "to be in serious money difficulties. i’ve got a pair of his shoes\n",
      "here—shoes with rubber studs in them. he had two pairs, almost exactly\n",
      "alike. i’m going up now to compare them with those footmarks. the\n",
      "constable is up there seeing that no one tampers with them.”\n",
      "“we’ll go at once,” said colonel melrose. “you and m. poirot will\n",
      "accompany us, will you not?”\n",
      "we assented, and all drove up in the colonel’s car. the inspector was\n",
      "anxious to get at once to the footmarks, and asked to be put down at\n",
      "the lodge. about half-way up the drive, on the right, a path branched\n",
      "off which led round to the terrace and the window of ackroyd’s study.\n",
      "“would you like to go with the inspector, m. poirot?” asked the chief\n",
      "constable, “or would you prefer to examine the study?”\n",
      "poirot chose the latter alternative. parker opened the door to us. his\n",
      "manner was smug and deferential, and he seemed to have recovered from\n",
      "his panic of the night before.\n",
      "colonel melrose took a key from his pocket, and unlocking the door\n",
      "which led into the lobby, he ushered us through into the study.\n",
      "“except for the removal of the body, m. poirot, this room is exactly as\n",
      "it was last night.”\n",
      "“and the body was found—where?”\n",
      "as precisely as possible, i described ackroyd’s position. the arm-chair\n",
      "still stood in front of the fire.\n",
      "poirot went and sat down in it.\n",
      "“the blue letter you speak of, where was it when you left the room?”\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd had laid it down on this little table at his right hand.”\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“except for that, everything was in its place?”\n",
      "“yes, i think so.”\n",
      "“colonel melrose, would you be so extremely obliging as to sit down in\n",
      "this chair a minute. i thank you. now, m. le docteur, will you kindly\n",
      "indicate to me the exact position of the dagger?”\n",
      "i did so, whilst the little man stood in the doorway.\n",
      "“the hilt of the dagger was plainly visible from the door then. both\n",
      "you and parker could see it at once?”\n",
      "“yes.”\n",
      "poirot went next to the window.\n",
      "“the electric light was on, of course, when you discovered the body?”\n",
      "he asked over his shoulder.\n",
      "i assented, and joined him where he was studying the marks on the\n",
      "window-sill.\n",
      "“the rubber studs are the same pattern as those in captain paton’s\n",
      "shoes,” he said quietly.\n",
      "then he came back once more to the middle of the room. his eye traveled\n",
      "round, searching everything in the room with a quick, trained glance.\n",
      "“are you a man of good observation, dr. sheppard?” he asked at last.\n",
      "“i think so,” i said, surprised.\n",
      "“there was a fire in the grate, i see. when you broke the door down and\n",
      "found mr. ackroyd dead, how was the fire? was it low?”\n",
      "i gave a vexed laugh.\n",
      "“i—i really can’t say. i didn’t notice. perhaps mr. raymond or major\n",
      "blunt——”\n",
      "the little man opposite me shook his head with a faint smile.\n",
      "“one must always proceed with method. i made an error of judgment in\n",
      "asking you that question. to each man his own knowledge. you could tell\n",
      "me the details of the patient’s appearance—nothing there would escape\n",
      "you. if i wanted information about the papers on that desk, mr. raymond\n",
      "would have noticed anything there was to see. to find out about the\n",
      "fire, i must ask the man whose business it is to observe such things.\n",
      "you permit——”\n",
      "he moved swiftly to the fireplace and rang the bell.\n",
      "after a lapse of a minute or two parker appeared.\n",
      "“the bell rang, sir,” he said hesitatingly.\n",
      "“come in, parker,” said colonel melrose. “this gentleman wants to ask\n",
      "you something.”\n",
      "parker transferred a respectful attention to poirot.\n",
      "“parker,” said the little man, “when you broke down the door with dr.\n",
      "sheppard last night, and found your master dead, what was the state of\n",
      "the fire?”\n",
      "parker replied without a pause.\n",
      "“it had burned very low, sir. it was almost out.”\n",
      "“ah!” said poirot. the exclamation sounded almost triumphant. he went\n",
      "on:—\n",
      "“look round you, my good parker. is this room exactly as it was then?”\n",
      "the butler’s eye swept round. it came to rest on the windows.\n",
      "“the curtains were drawn, sir, and the electric light was on.”\n",
      "poirot nodded approval.\n",
      "“anything else?”\n",
      "“yes, sir, this chair was drawn out a little more.”\n",
      "he indicated a big grandfather chair to the left of the door between it\n",
      "and the window. i append a plan of the room with the chair in question\n",
      "marked with an x.\n",

      "i did. king’s abbot is a mere village, but its station happens to\n",
      "be an important junction. most of the big expresses stop there, and\n",
      "trains are shunted, re-sorted, and made up. it has two or three public\n",
      "telephone boxes. at that time of night three local trains come in\n",

      "he went to the window and stood there, looking out.\n",
      "“you say it was nine o’clock, dr. sheppard, when you met this stranger\n",

      "“young raymond could tell us that,” i said.\n",
      "“or parker,” suggested colonel melrose.\n",
      "“_ou tous les deux_,” suggested poirot, smiling.\n",
      "colonel melrose went in search of raymond, and i rang the bell once\n",
      "more for parker.\n",
      "colonel melrose returned almost immediately, accompanied by the young\n",

      "poirot had been standing just to the left of the door. now he moved\n",
      "aside suddenly, and i saw that while my back was turned he must have\n",
      "swiftly drawn out the arm-chair till it stood in the position parker\n",
      "had indicated.\n",
      "“want me to sit in the chair whilst you take a blood test?” asked\n",
      "raymond good-humoredly. “what’s the idea?”\n",

      "was found killed. some one moved it back again into place. did you do\n",
      "so?”\n",
      "the secretary’s reply came without a second’s hesitation.\n",
      "“no, indeed i didn’t. i don’t even remember that it was in that\n",
      "position, but it must have been if you say so. anyway, somebody else\n",
      "must have moved it back to its proper place. have they destroyed a clew\n",
      "in doing so? too bad!”\n",
      "“it is of no consequence,” said the detective. “of no consequence\n",
      "whatever. what i really want to ask you is this, m. raymond: did any\n",
      "stranger come to see mr. ackroyd during this past week?”\n",
      "the secretary reflected for a minute or two, knitting his brows, and\n",
      "during the pause parker appeared in answer to the bell.\n",
      "“no,” said raymond at last. “i can’t remember any one. can you, parker?”\n",
      "“i beg your pardon, sir?”\n",
      "“any stranger coming to see mr. ackroyd this week?”\n",
      "the butler reflected for a minute or two.\n",
      "“there was the young man who came on wednesday, sir,” he said at last.\n",
      "“from curtis and troute, i understood he was.”\n",
      "raymond moved this aside with an impatient hand.\n",
      "“oh! yes, i remember, but that is not the kind of stranger this\n",
      "gentleman means.” he turned to poirot. “mr. ackroyd had some idea of\n",
      "purchasing a dictaphone,” he explained. “it would have enabled us to\n",
      "get through a lot more work in a limited time. the firm in question\n",
      "sent down their representative, but nothing came of it. mr. ackroyd did\n",
      "not make up his mind to purchase.”\n",
      "poirot turned to the butler.\n",
      "“can you describe this young man to me, my good parker?”\n",
      "“he was fair-haired, sir, and short. very neatly dressed in a blue\n",
      "serge suit. a very presentable young man, sir, for his station in life.”\n",
      "poirot turned to me.\n",
      "“the man you met outside the gate, doctor, was tall, was he not?”\n",
      "“yes,” i said. “somewhere about six feet, i should say.”\n",
      "“there is nothing in that, then,” declared the belgian. “i thank you,\n",
      "parker.”\n",
      "the butler spoke to raymond.\n",
      "“mr. hammond has just arrived, sir,” he said. “he is anxious to know if\n",
      "he can be of any service, and he would be glad to have a word with you.”\n",
      "“i’ll come at once,” said the young man. he hurried out. poirot looked\n",
      "inquiringly at the chief constable.\n",
      "“the family solicitor, m. poirot,” said the latter.\n",
      "“it is a busy time for this young m. raymond,” murmured m. poirot. “he\n",
      "has the air efficient, that one.”\n",
      "“i believe mr. ackroyd considered him a most able secretary.”\n",
      "“he has been here—how long?”\n",
      "“just on two years, i fancy.”\n",
      "“his duties he fulfills punctiliously. of that i am sure. in what\n",
      "manner does he amuse himself? does he go in for _le sport_?”\n",
      "“private secretaries haven’t much time for that sort of thing,” said\n",
      "colonel melrose, smiling. “raymond plays golf, i believe. and tennis in\n",
      "the summer time.”\n",
      "“he does not attend the courses—i should say the running of the horses?”\n",
      "“race meetings? no, i don’t think he’s interested in racing.”\n",
      "poirot nodded and seemed to lose interest. he glanced slowly round the\n",

      "“i have seen, i think, all that there is to be seen here.”\n",
      "i, too, looked round.\n",
      "“if those walls could speak,” i murmured.\n",
      "poirot shook his head.\n",
      "“a tongue is not enough,” he said. “they would have to have also eyes\n",
      "and ears. but do not be too sure that these dead things”—he touched\n",
      "the top of the bookcase as he spoke—“are always dumb. to me they speak\n",
      "sometimes—chairs, tables—they have their message!”\n",
      "he turned away towards the door.\n",
      "“what message?” i cried. “what have they said to you to-day?”\n",
      "he looked over his shoulder and raised one eyebrow quizzically.\n",
      "“an opened window,” he said. “a locked door. a chair that apparently\n",
      "moved itself. to all three i say, ‘why?’ and i find no answer.”\n",
      "he shook his head, puffed out his chest, and stood blinking at us. he\n",
      "looked ridiculously full of his own importance. it crossed my mind\n",
      "to wonder whether he was really any good as a detective. had his big\n",
      "reputation been built up on a series of lucky chances?\n",
      "i think the same thought must have occurred to colonel melrose, for he\n",
      "frowned.\n",
      "“anything more you want to see, m. poirot?” he inquired brusquely.\n",
      "“you would perhaps be so kind as to show me the silver table from which\n",
      "the weapon was taken? after that, i will trespass on your kindness no\n",
      "longer.”\n",
      "we went to the drawing-room, but on the way the constable waylaid the\n",
      "colonel, and after a muttered conversation the latter excused himself\n",
      "and left us together. i showed poirot the silver table, and after\n",
      "raising the lid once or twice and letting it fall, he pushed open the\n",
      "window and stepped out on the terrace. i followed him.\n",
      "inspector raglan had just turned the corner of the house, and was\n",
      "coming towards us. his face looked grim and satisfied.\n",
      "“so there you are, m. poirot,” he said. “well, this isn’t going to be\n",
      "much of a case. i’m sorry, too. a nice enough young fellow gone wrong.”\n",
      "poirot’s face fell, and he spoke very mildly.\n",
      "“i’m afraid i shall not be able to be of much aid to you, then?”\n",
      "“next time, perhaps,” said the inspector soothingly. “though we don’t\n",
      "have murders every day in this quiet little corner of the world.”\n",
      "poirot’s gaze took on an admiring quality.\n",
      "“you have been of a marvelous promptness,” he observed. “how exactly\n",
      "did you go to work, if i may ask?”\n",
      "“certainly,” said the inspector. “to begin with—method. that’s what i\n",
      "always say—method!”\n",
      "“ah!” cried the other. “that, too, is my watchword. method, order, and\n",
      "the little gray cells.”\n",
      "“the cells?” said the inspector, staring.\n",
      "“the little gray cells of the brain,” explained the belgian.\n",
      "“oh, of course; well, we all use them, i suppose.”\n",
      "“in a greater or lesser degree,” murmured poirot. “and there are, too,\n",
      "differences in quality. then there is the psychology of a crime. one\n",
      "must study that.”\n",
      "“ah!” said the inspector, “you’ve been bitten with all this\n",
      "psychoanalysis stuff? now, i’m a plain man——”\n",
      "“mrs. raglan would not agree, i am sure, to that,” said poirot, making\n",
      "him a little bow.\n",
      "inspector raglan, a little taken aback, bowed.\n",
      "“you don’t understand,” he said, grinning broadly. “lord, what a lot of\n",
      "difference language makes. i’m telling you how i set to work. first of\n",
      "all, method. mr. ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by his\n",
      "niece, miss flora ackroyd. that’s fact number one, isn’t it?”\n",
      "“if you say so.”\n",
      "“well, it is. at half-past ten, the doctor here says that mr. ackroyd\n",
      "has been dead at least half an hour. you stick to that, doctor?”\n",
      "“certainly,” i said. “half an hour or longer.”\n",
      "“very good. that gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the\n",
      "crime must have been committed. i make a list of every one in the\n",
      "house, and work through it, setting down opposite their names where\n",
      "they were and what they were doing between the hour of 9.45 and 10 p.m.”\n",
      "he handed a sheet of paper to poirot. i read it over his shoulder. it\n",
      "ran as follows, written in a neat script:—\n",
      " _major blunt.—in billiard room with mr. raymond. (latter confirms.)_\n",
      " _mr. raymond.—billiard room. (see above.)_\n",
      " _mrs. ackroyd.—9.45 watching billiard match. went up to bed 9.55.\n",
      " (raymond and blunt watched her up staircase.)_\n",
      " _miss ackroyd.—went straight from her uncle’s room upstairs.\n",
      " (confirmed by parker, also housemaid, elsie dale.)_\n",
      " _servants_:—\n",
      " _parker.—went straight to butler’s pantry. (confirmed by\n",
      " housekeeper, miss russell, who came down to speak to him about\n",
      " something at 9.47, and remained at least ten minutes.)_\n",
      " _miss russell.—as above. spoke to housemaid, elsie dale, upstairs\n",
      " at 9.45._\n",
      " _ursula bourne (parlormaid).—in her own room until 9.55. then in\n",

      " miss flora ackroyd._\n",
      " _mary thripp (kitchenmaid).—servants’ hall._\n",
      "“the cook has been here seven years, the parlormaid eighteen months,\n",
      "and parker just over a year. the others are new. except for something\n",
      "fishy about parker, they all seem quite all right.”\n",
      "“a very complete list,” said poirot, handing it back to him. “i am\n",
      "quite sure that parker did not do the murder,” he added gravely.\n",
      "“so is my sister,” i struck in. “and she’s usually right.” nobody paid\n",
      "any attention to my interpolation.\n",
      "“that disposes pretty effectually of the household,” continued the\n",
      "inspector. “now we come to a very grave point. the woman at the\n",
      "lodge—mary black—was pulling the curtains last night when she saw\n",
      "ralph paton turn in at the gate and go up towards the house.”\n",
      "“she is sure of that?” i asked sharply.\n",
      "“quite sure. she knows him well by sight. he went past very quickly\n",
      "and turned off by the path to the right, which is a short cut to the\n",
      "terrace.”\n",
      "“and what time was that?” asked poirot, who had sat with an immovable\n",
      "face.\n",
      "“exactly twenty-five minutes past nine,” said the inspector gravely.\n",
      "there was a silence. then the inspector spoke again.\n",
      "“it’s all clear enough. it fits in without a flaw. at twenty-five\n",
      "minutes past nine, captain paton is seen passing the lodge; at\n",
      "nine-thirty or thereabouts, mr. geoffrey raymond hears some one in here\n",
      "asking for money and mr. ackroyd refusing. what happens next? captain\n",
      "paton leaves the same way—through the window. he walks along the\n",
      "terrace, angry and baffled. he comes to the open drawing-room window.\n",
      "say it’s now a quarter to ten. miss flora ackroyd is saying good-night\n",
      "to her uncle. major blunt, mr. raymond, and mrs. ackroyd are in the\n",
      "billiard room. the drawing-room is empty. he steals in, takes the\n",
      "dagger from the silver table, and returns to the study window. he slips\n",
      "off his shoes, climbs in, and—well, i don’t need to go into details.\n",
      "then he slips out again and goes off. hadn’t the nerve to go back to\n",
      "the inn. he makes for the station, rings up from there——”\n",
      "“why?” said poirot softly.\n",
      "i jumped at the interruption. the little man was leaning forward. his\n",
      "eyes shone with a queer green light.\n",
      "for a moment inspector raglan was taken aback by the question.\n",
      "“it’s difficult to say exactly why he did that,” he said at last. “but\n",
      "murderers do funny things. you’d know that if you were in the police\n",
      "force. the cleverest of them make stupid mistakes sometimes. but come\n",
      "along and i’ll show you those footprints.”\n",
      "we followed him round the corner of the terrace to the study window. at\n",
      "a word from raglan a police constable produced the shoes which had been\n",
      "obtained from the local inn.\n",
      "the inspector laid them over the marks.\n",
      "“they’re the same,” he said confidently. “that is to say, they’re not\n",
      "the same pair that actually made these prints. he went away in those.\n",
      "this is a pair just like them, but older—see how the studs are worn\n",
      "down.”\n",
      "“surely a great many people wear shoes with rubber studs in them?”\n",
      "asked poirot.\n",
      "“that’s so, of course,” said the inspector. “i shouldn’t put so much\n",
      "stress on the footmarks if it wasn’t for everything else.”\n",
      "“a very foolish young man, captain ralph paton,” said poirot\n",
      "thoughtfully. “to leave so much evidence of his presence.”\n",
      "“ah! well,” said the inspector, “it was a dry, fine night, you know. he\n",
      "left no prints on the terrace or on the graveled path. but, unluckily\n",
      "for him, a spring must have welled up just lately at the end of the\n",
      "path from the drive. see here.”\n",
      "a small graveled path joined the terrace a few feet away. in one\n",
      "spot, a few yards from its termination, the ground was wet and boggy.\n",
      "crossing this wet place there were again the marks of footsteps, and\n",
      "amongst them the shoes with rubber studs.\n",
      "poirot followed the path on a little way, the inspector by his side.\n",
      "“you noticed the women’s footprints?” he said suddenly.\n",
      "the inspector laughed.\n",
      "“naturally. but several different women have walked this way—and men\n",
      "as well. it’s a regular short cut to the house, you see. it would be\n",
      "impossible to sort out all the footsteps. after all, it’s the ones on\n",
      "the window-sill that are really important.”\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“it’s no good going farther,” said the inspector, as we came in view of\n",
      "the drive. “it’s all graveled again here, and hard as it can be.”\n",
      "again poirot nodded, but his eyes were fixed on a small garden house—a\n",
      "kind of superior summer-house. it was a little to the left of the path\n",
      "ahead of us, and a graveled walk ran up to it.\n",
      "poirot lingered about until the inspector had gone back towards the\n",
      "house. then he looked at me.\n",
      "“you must have indeed been sent from the good god to replace my\n",
      "friend hastings,” he said, with a twinkle. “i observe that you do not\n",
      "quit my side. how say you, dr. sheppard, shall we investigate that\n",
      "summer-house? it interests me.”\n",
      "he went up to the door and opened it. inside, the place was almost\n",
      "dark. there were one or two rustic seats, a croquet set, and some\n",
      "folded deck-chairs.\n",
      "i was startled to observe my new friend. he had dropped to his hands\n",
      "and knees and was crawling about the floor. every now and then he shook\n",
      "his head as though not satisfied. finally, he sat back on his heels.\n",
      "“nothing,” he murmured. “well, perhaps it was not to be expected. but\n",
      "it would have meant so much——”\n",
      "he broke off, stiffening all over. then he stretched out his hand to\n",
      "one of the rustic chairs. he detached something from one side of it.\n",
      "“what is it?” i cried. “what have you found?”\n",
      "he smiled, unclosing his hand so that i should see what lay in the palm\n",
      "of it. a scrap of stiff white cambric.\n",
      "i took it from him, looked at it curiously, and then handed it back.\n",
      "“what do you make of it, eh, my friend?” he asked, eyeing me keenly.\n",
      "“a scrap torn from a handkerchief,” i suggested, shrugging my shoulders.\n",
      "he made another dart and picked up a small quill—a goose quill by the\n",
      "look of it.\n",
      "“and that?” he cried triumphantly. “what do you make of that?”\n",
      "i only stared.\n",
      "he slipped the quill into his pocket, and looked again at the scrap of\n",
      "white stuff.\n",
      "“a fragment of a handkerchief?” he mused. “perhaps you are right. but\n",
      "remember this—_a good laundry does not starch a handkerchief_.”\n",
      "he nodded at me triumphantly, then he put away the scrap carefully in\n",
      "his pocket-book.\n",
      " chapter ix\n",
      " the goldfish pond\n",
      "we walked back to the house together. there was no sign of the\n",
      "inspector. poirot paused on the terrace and stood with his back to the\n",
      "house, slowly turning his head from side to side.\n",
      "“_une belle propriété_,” he said at last appreciatively. “who inherits\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "his words gave me almost a shock. it is an odd thing, but until that\n",
      "moment the question of inheritance had never come into my head. poirot\n",
      "watched me keenly.\n",
      "“it is a new idea to you, that,” he said at last. “you had not thought\n",
      "of it before—eh?”\n",
      "“no,” i said truthfully. “i wish i had.”\n",
      "he looked at me again curiously.\n",
      "“i wonder just what you mean by that,” he said thoughtfully. “ah! no,”\n",
      "as i was about to speak. “_inutile!_ you would not tell me your real\n",
      "thought.”\n",
      "“every one has something to hide,” i quoted, smiling.\n",
      "“exactly.”\n",
      "“you still believe that?”\n",
      "“more than ever, my friend. but it is not easy to hide things from\n",
      "hercule poirot. he has a knack of finding out.”\n",
      "he descended the steps of the dutch garden as he spoke.\n",
      "“let us walk a little,” he said over his shoulder. “the air is pleasant\n",
      "to-day.”\n",
      "i followed him. he led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew\n",
      "hedges. a walk led down the middle, bordered each side with formal\n",
      "flower beds, and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and\n",
      "a pond of goldfish. instead of pursuing the path to the end, poirot\n",
      "took another which wound up the side of a wooded slope. in one spot the\n",
      "trees had been cleared away, and a seat had been put. sitting there one\n",
      "had a splendid view over the countryside, and one looked right down on\n",
      "the paved recess and the goldfish pond.\n",
      "“england is very beautiful,” said poirot, his eyes straying over the\n",
      "prospect. then he smiled. “and so are english girls,” he said in a\n",
      "lower tone. “hush, my friend, and look at the pretty picture below us.”\n",
      "it was then that i saw flora. she was moving along the path we had\n",
      "just left and she was humming a little snatch of song. her step was\n",
      "more dancing than walking, and in spite of her black dress, there was\n",
      "nothing but joy in her whole attitude. she gave a sudden pirouette on\n",
      "her toes, and her black draperies swung out. at the same time she flung\n",
      "her head back and laughed outright.\n",
      "as she did so a man stepped out from the trees. it was hector blunt.\n",
      "the girl started. her expression changed a little.\n",
      "“how you startled me—i didn’t see you.”\n",
      "blunt said nothing, but stood looking at her for a minute or two in\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "“what i like about you,” said flora, with a touch of malice, “is your\n",
      "cheery conversation.”\n",
      "i fancy that at that blunt reddened under his tan. his voice, when he\n",
      "spoke, sounded different—it had a curious sort of humility in it.\n",
      "“never was much of a fellow for talking. not even when i was young.”\n",
      "“that was a very long time ago, i suppose,” said flora gravely.\n",
      "i caught the undercurrent of laughter in her voice, but i don’t think\n",
      "blunt did.\n",
      "“yes,” he said simply, “it was.”\n",
      "“how does it feel to be methuselah?” asked flora.\n",
      "this time the laughter was more apparent, but blunt was following out\n",
      "an idea of his own.\n",
      "“remember the johnny who sold his soul to the devil? in return for\n",
      "being made young again? there’s an opera about it.”\n",
      "“faust, you mean?”\n",
      "“that’s the beggar. rum story. some of us would do it if we could.”\n",
      "“any one would think you were creaking at the joints to hear you talk,”\n",
      "cried flora, half vexed, half amused.\n",
      "blunt said nothing for a minute or two. then he looked away from flora\n",
      "into the middle distance and observed to an adjacent tree trunk that it\n",
      "was about time he got back to africa.\n",
      "“are you going on another expedition—shooting things?”\n",
      "“expect so. usually do, you know—shoot things, i mean.”\n",
      "“you shot that head in the hall, didn’t you?”\n",
      "blunt nodded. then he jerked out, going rather red, as he did so:—\n",
      "“care for some decent skins any time? if so, i could get ’em for you.”\n",
      "“oh! please do,” cried flora. “will you really? you won’t forget?”\n",
      "“i shan’t forget,” said hector blunt.\n",
      "he added, in a sudden burst of communicativeness:—\n",
      "“time i went. i’m no good in this sort of life. haven’t got the manners\n",
      "for it. i’m a rough fellow, no use in society. never remember the\n",
      "things one’s expected to say. yes, time i went.”\n",
      "“but you’re not going at once,” cried flora. “not—not while we’re in\n",
      "all this trouble. oh! please. if you go——”\n",
      "she turned away a little.\n",
      "“you want me to stay?” asked blunt.\n",
      "he spoke deliberately but quite simply.\n",
      "“we all——”\n",
      "“i meant you personally,” said blunt, with directness.\n",
      "flora turned slowly back again and met his eyes.\n",
      "“i want you to stay,” she said, “if—if that makes any difference.”\n",
      "“it makes all the difference,” said blunt.\n",
      "there was a moment’s silence. they sat down on the stone seat by the\n",
      "goldfish pond. it seemed as though neither of them knew quite what to\n",
      "say next.\n",
      "“it—it’s such a lovely morning,” said flora at last. “you know, i can’t\n",
      "help feeling happy, in spite—in spite of everything. that’s awful, i\n",
      "suppose?”\n",
      "“quite natural,” said blunt. “never saw your uncle until two years ago,\n",
      "did you? can’t be expected to grieve very much. much better to have no\n",
      "humbug about it.”\n",
      "“there’s something awfully consoling about you,” said flora. “you make\n",
      "things so simple.”\n",
      "“things are simple as a rule,” said the big game hunter.\n",
      "“not always,” said flora.\n",
      "her voice had lowered itself, and i saw blunt turn and look at her,\n",
      "bringing his eyes back from (apparently) the coast of africa to do so.\n",
      "he evidently put his own construction on her change of tone, for he\n",
      "said, after a minute or two, in rather an abrupt manner:—\n",
      "“i say, you know, you mustn’t worry. about that young chap, i mean.\n",
      "inspector’s an ass. everybody knows—utterly absurd to think he could\n",
      "have done it. man from outside. burglar chap. that’s the only possible\n",
      "solution.”\n",
      "flora turned to look at him.\n",
      "“you really think so?”\n",
      "“don’t you?” said blunt quickly.\n",
      "“i—oh, yes, of course.”\n",
      "another silence, and then flora burst out:—\n",
      "“i’m—i’ll tell you why i felt so happy this morning. however heartless\n",
      "you think me, i’d rather tell you. it’s because the lawyer has been—mr.\n",
      "hammond. he told us about the will. uncle roger has left me twenty\n",
      "thousand pounds. think of it—twenty thousand beautiful pounds.”\n",
      "blunt looked surprised.\n",
      "“does it mean so much to you?”\n",
      "“mean much to me? why, it’s everything. freedom—life—no more scheming\n",
      "and scraping and lying——”\n",
      "“lying?” said blunt, sharply interrupting.\n",
      "flora seemed taken aback for a minute.\n",
      "“you know what i mean,” she said uncertainly. “pretending to be\n",
      "thankful for all the nasty castoff things rich relations give you. last\n",
      "year’s coats and skirts and hats.”\n",
      "“don’t know much about ladies’ clothes; should have said you were\n",
      "always very well turned out.”\n",
      "“it’s cost me something, though,” said flora in a low voice. “don’t\n",
      "let’s talk of horrid things. i’m so happy. i’m free. free to do what i\n",
      "like. free not to——”\n",
      "she stopped suddenly.\n",
      "“not to what?” asked blunt quickly.\n",
      "“i forget now. nothing important.”\n",
      "blunt had a stick in his hand, and he thrust it into the pond, poking\n",
      "at something.\n",
      "“what are you doing, major blunt?”\n",
      "“there’s something bright down there. wondered what it was—looks like a\n",
      "gold brooch. now i’ve stirred up the mud and it’s gone.”\n",
      "“perhaps it’s a crown,” suggested flora. “like the one mélisande saw in\n",
      "the water.”\n",
      "“mélisande,” said blunt reflectively—“she’s in an opera, isn’t she?”\n",
      "“yes, you seem to know a lot about operas.”\n",
      "“people take me sometimes,” said blunt sadly. “funny idea of\n",
      "pleasure—worse racket than the natives make with their tom-toms.”\n",
      "flora laughed.\n",
      "“i remember mélisande,” continued blunt, “married an old chap old\n",
      "enough to be her father.”\n",
      "he threw a small piece of flint into the goldfish pond. then, with a\n",
      "change of manner, he turned to flora.\n",
      "“miss ackroyd, can i do anything? about paton, i mean. i know how\n",
      "dreadfully anxious you must be.”\n",
      "“thank you,” said flora in a cold voice. “there is really nothing to\n",
      "be done. ralph will be all right. i’ve got hold of the most wonderful\n",
      "detective in the world, and he’s going to find out all about it.”\n",
      "for some time i had felt uneasy as to our position. we were not exactly\n",
      "eavesdropping, since the two in the garden below had only to lift their\n",
      "heads to see us. nevertheless, i should have drawn attention to our\n",
      "presence before now, had not my companion put a warning pressure on my\n",
      "arm. clearly he wished me to remain silent.\n",
      "but now he rose briskly to his feet, clearing his throat.\n",
      "“i demand pardon,” he cried. “i cannot allow mademoiselle thus\n",
      "extravagantly to compliment me, and not draw attention to my presence.\n",
      "they say the listener hears no good of himself, but that is not the\n",
      "case this time. to spare my blushes, i must join you and apologize.”\n",
      "he hurried down the path with me close behind him, and joined the\n",
      "others by the pond.\n",
      "“this is m. hercule poirot,” said flora. “i expect you’ve heard of him.”\n",
      "poirot bowed.\n",
      "“i know major blunt by reputation,” he said politely. “i am glad to\n",
      "have encountered you, monsieur. i am in need of some information that\n",
      "you can give me.”\n",
      "blunt looked at him inquiringly.\n",
      "“when did you last see m. ackroyd alive?”\n",
      "“at dinner.”\n",
      "“and you neither saw nor heard anything of him after that?”\n",
      "“didn’t see him. heard his voice.”\n",
      "“how was that?”\n",
      "“i strolled out on the terrace——”\n",
      "“pardon me, what time was this?”\n",
      "“about half-past nine. i was walking up and down smoking in front of\n",
      "the drawing-room window. i heard ackroyd talking in his study——”\n",
      "poirot stooped and removed a microscopic weed.\n",
      "“surely you couldn’t hear voices in the study from that part of the\n",
      "terrace,” he murmured.\n",
      "he was not looking at blunt, but i was, and to my intense surprise, i\n",
      "saw the latter flush.\n",
      "“went as far as the corner,” he explained unwillingly.\n",
      "“ah! indeed?” said poirot.\n",
      "in the mildest manner he conveyed an impression that more was wanted.\n",
      "“thought i saw—a woman disappearing into the bushes. just a gleam of\n",
      "white, you know. must have been mistaken. it was while i was standing\n",
      "at the corner of the terrace that i heard ackroyd’s voice speaking to\n",
      "that secretary of his.”\n",
      "“speaking to mr. geoffrey raymond?”\n",
      "“yes—that’s what i supposed at the time. seems i was wrong.”\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd didn’t address him by name?”\n",
      "“oh, no.”\n",
      "“then, if i may ask, why did you think——?”\n",
      "blunt explained laboriously.\n",
      "“took it for granted that it _would_ be raymond, because he had said\n",
      "just before i came out that he was taking some papers to ackroyd. never\n",
      "thought of it being anybody else.”\n",
      "“can you remember what the words you heard were?”\n",
      "“afraid i can’t. something quite ordinary and unimportant. only caught\n",
      "a scrap of it. i was thinking of something else at the time.”\n",
      "“it is of no importance,” murmured poirot. “did you move a chair back\n",
      "against the wall when you went into the study after the body was\n",
      "discovered?”\n",
      "“chair? no—why should i?”\n",
      "poirot shrugged his shoulders but did not answer. he turned to flora.\n",
      "“there is one thing i should like to know from you, mademoiselle. when\n",
      "you were examining the things in the silver table with dr. sheppard,\n",
      "was the dagger in its place, or was it not?”\n",
      "flora’s chin shot up.\n",
      "“inspector raglan has been asking me that,” she said resentfully. “i’ve\n",
      "told him, and i’ll tell you. i’m perfectly certain the dagger was _not_\n",
      "there. he thinks it was and that ralph sneaked it later in the evening.\n",
      "and—and he doesn’t believe me. he thinks i’m saying it to—to shield\n",
      "ralph.”\n",
      "“and aren’t you?” i asked gravely.\n",
      "flora stamped her foot.\n",
      "“you, too, dr. sheppard! oh! it’s too bad.”\n",
      "poirot tactfully made a diversion.\n",
      "“it is true what i heard you say, major blunt. there is something that\n",
      "glitters in this pond. let us see if i can reach it.”\n",
      "he knelt down by the pond, baring his arm to the elbow, and lowered it\n",
      "in very slowly, so as not to disturb the bottom of the pond. but in\n",
      "spite of all his precautions the mud eddied and swirled, and he was\n",
      "forced to draw his arm out again empty-handed.\n",
      "he gazed ruefully at the mud upon his arm. i offered him my\n",
      "handkerchief, which he accepted with fervent protestations of thanks.\n",
      "blunt looked at his watch.\n",
      "“nearly lunch time,” he said. “we’d better be getting back to the\n",
      "house.”\n",
      "“you will lunch with us, m. poirot?” asked flora. “i should like you to\n",
      "meet my mother. she is—very fond of ralph.”\n",
      "the little man bowed.\n",
      "“i shall be delighted, mademoiselle.”\n",
      "“and you will stay, too, won’t you, dr. sheppard?”\n",
      "i hesitated.\n",
      "“oh, do!”\n",
      "i wanted to, so i accepted the invitation without further ceremony.\n",
      "we set out towards the house, flora and blunt walking ahead.\n",
      "“what hair,” said poirot to me in a low tone, nodding towards flora.\n",
      "“the real gold! they will make a pretty couple. she and the dark,\n",
      "handsome captain paton. will they not?”\n",
      "i looked at him inquiringly, but he began to fuss about a few\n",
      "microscopic drops of water on his coat sleeve. the man reminded me in\n",
      "some ways of a cat. his green eyes and his finicking habits.\n",
      "“and all for nothing, too,” i said sympathetically. “i wonder what it\n",
      "was in the pond?”\n",
      "“would you like to see?” asked poirot.\n",
      "i stared at him. he nodded.\n",
      "“my good friend,” he said gently and reproachfully, “hercule poirot\n",
      "does not run the risk of disarranging his costume without being sure\n",
      "of attaining his object. to do so would be ridiculous and absurd. i am\n",
      "never ridiculous.”\n",
      "“but you brought your hand out empty,” i objected.\n",
      "“there are times when it is necessary to have discretion. do you tell\n",
      "your patients everything—everything, doctor? i think not. nor do you\n",
      "tell your excellent sister everything either, is it not so? before\n",
      "showing my empty hand, i dropped what it contained into my other hand.\n",
      "you shall see what that was.”\n",
      "he held out his left hand, palm open. on it lay a little circlet of\n",
      "gold. a woman’s wedding ring.\n",
      "i took it from him.\n",
      "“look inside,” commanded poirot.\n",
      "i did so. inside was an inscription in fine writing:—\n",
      " _from r., march 13th._\n",
      "i looked at poirot, but he was busy inspecting his appearance in a tiny\n",
      "pocket glass. he paid particular attention to his mustaches, and none\n",
      "at all to me. i saw that he did not intend to be communicative.\n",
      " chapter x\n",
      " the parlormaid\n",
      "we found mrs. ackroyd in the hall. with her was a small dried-up little\n",
      "man, with an aggressive chin and sharp gray eyes, and “lawyer” written\n",
      "all over him.\n",
      "“mr. hammond is staying to lunch with us,” said mrs. ackroyd. “you know\n",
      "major blunt, mr. hammond? and dear dr. sheppard—also a close friend of\n",
      "poor roger’s. and, let me see——”\n",
      "she paused, surveying hercule poirot in some perplexity.\n",
      "“this is m. poirot, mother,” said flora. “i told you about him this\n",
      "morning.”\n",
      "“oh! yes,” said mrs. ackroyd vaguely. “of course, my dear, of course.\n",
      "he is to find ralph, is he not?”\n",
      "“he is to find out who killed uncle,” said flora.\n",
      "“oh! my dear,” cried her mother. “please! my poor nerves. i am a wreck\n",
      "this morning, a positive wreck. such a dreadful thing to happen. i\n",
      "can’t help feeling that it must have been an accident of some kind.\n",
      "roger was so fond of handling queer curios. his hand must have slipped,\n",
      "or something.”\n",
      "this theory was received in polite silence. i saw poirot edge up to the\n",
      "lawyer, and speak to him in a confidential undertone. they moved aside\n",
      "into the embrasure of the window. i joined them—then hesitated.\n",
      "“perhaps i’m intruding,” i said.\n",
      "“not at all,” cried poirot heartily. “you and i, m. le docteur, we\n",
      "investigate this affair side by side. without you i should be lost. i\n",
      "desire a little information from the good mr. hammond.”\n",
      "“you are acting on behalf of captain ralph paton, i understand,” said\n",
      "the lawyer cautiously.\n",
      "poirot shook his head.\n",
      "“not so. i am acting in the interests of justice. miss ackroyd has\n",
      "asked me to investigate the death of her uncle.”\n",
      "mr. hammond seemed slightly taken aback.\n",
      "“i cannot seriously believe that captain paton can be concerned in this\n",
      "crime,” he said, “however strong the circumstantial evidence against\n",
      "him may be. the mere fact that he was hard pressed for money——”\n",
      "“was he hard pressed for money?” interpolated poirot quickly.\n",
      "the lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "“it was a chronic condition with ralph paton,” he said dryly. “money\n",
      "went through his hands like water. he was always applying to his\n",
      "stepfather.”\n",
      "“had he done so of late? during the last year, for instance?”\n",
      "“i cannot say. mr. ackroyd did not mention the fact to me.”\n",
      "“i comprehend. mr. hammond, i take it that you are acquainted with the\n",
      "provisions of mr. ackroyd’s will?”\n",
      "“certainly. that is my principal business here to-day.”\n",
      "“then, seeing that i am acting for miss ackroyd, you will not object to\n",
      "telling me the terms of that will?”\n",
      "“they are quite simple. shorn of legal phraseology, and after paying\n",
      "certain legacies and bequests——”\n",
      "“such as——?” interrupted poirot.\n",
      "mr. hammond seemed a little surprised.\n",
      "“a thousand pounds to his housekeeper, miss russell; fifty pounds\n",
      "to the cook, emma cooper; five hundred pounds to his secretary, mr.\n",
      "geoffrey raymond. then to various hospitals——”\n",
      "poirot held up his hand.\n",
      "“ah! the charitable bequests, they interest me not.”\n",
      "“quite so. the income on ten thousand pounds’ worth of shares to be\n",
      "paid to mrs. cecil ackroyd during her lifetime. miss flora ackroyd\n",
      "inherits twenty thousand pounds outright. the residue—including this\n",
      "property, and the shares in ackroyd and son—to his adopted son, ralph\n",
      "paton.”\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd possessed a large fortune?”\n",
      "“a very large fortune. captain paton will be an exceedingly wealthy\n",
      "young man.”\n",
      "there was a silence. poirot and the lawyer looked at each other.\n",
      "“mr. hammond,” came mrs. ackroyd’s voice plaintively from the fireplace.\n",
      "the lawyer answered the summons. poirot took my arm and drew me right\n",
      "into the window.\n",
      "“regard the irises,” he remarked in rather a loud voice. “magnificent,\n",
      "are they not? a straight and pleasing effect.”\n",
      "at the same time i felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and he\n",
      "added in a low tone:—\n",
      "“do you really wish to aid me? to take part in this investigation?”\n",
      "“yes, indeed,” i said eagerly. “there’s nothing i should like better.\n",
      "you don’t know what a dull old fogey’s life i lead. never anything out\n",
      "of the ordinary.”\n",
      "“good, we will be colleagues then. in a minute or two i fancy major\n",
      "blunt will join us. he is not happy with the good mamma. now there are\n",
      "some things i want to know—but i do not wish to seem to want to know\n",
      "them. you comprehend? so it will be your part to ask the questions.”\n",
      "“what questions do you want me to ask?” i asked apprehensively.\n",
      "“i want you to introduce the name of mrs. ferrars.”\n",
      "“yes?”\n",
      "“speak of her in a natural fashion. ask him if he was down here when\n",
      "her husband died. you understand the kind of thing i mean. and while he\n",
      "replies, watch his face without seeming to watch it. _c’est compris?_”\n",
      "there was no time for more, for at that minute, as poirot had\n",
      "prophesied, blunt left the others in his abrupt fashion and came over\n",
      "to us.\n",
      "i suggested strolling on the terrace, and he acquiesced. poirot stayed\n",
      "behind.\n",
      "i stopped to examine a late rose.\n",
      "“how things change in the course of a day or so,” i observed. “i was\n",
      "up here last wednesday, i remember, walking up and down this same\n",
      "terrace. ackroyd was with me—full of spirits. and now—three days\n",
      "later—ackroyd’s dead, poor fellow, mrs. ferrars’s dead—you knew her,\n",
      "didn’t you? but of course you did.”\n",
      "blunt nodded his head.\n",
      "“had you seen her since you’d been down this time?”\n",
      "“went with ackroyd to call. last tuesday, think it was. fascinating\n",
      "woman—but something queer about her. deep—one would never know what she\n",
      "was up to.”\n",
      "i looked into his steady gray eyes. nothing there surely. i went on:—\n",
      "“i suppose you’d met her before.”\n",
      "“last time i was here—she and her husband had just come here to live.”\n",
      "he paused a minute and then added: “rum thing, she had changed a lot\n",
      "between then and now.”\n",
      "“how—changed?” i asked.\n",
      "“looked ten years older.”\n",
      "“were you down here when her husband died?” i asked, trying to make the\n",
      "question sound as casual as possible.\n",
      "“no. from all i heard it would be a good riddance. uncharitable,\n",
      "perhaps, but the truth.”\n",
      "i agreed.\n",
      "“ashley ferrars was by no means a pattern husband,” i said cautiously.\n",
      "“blackguard, i thought,” said blunt.\n",
      "“no,” i said, “only a man with more money than was good for him.”\n",
      "“oh! money! all the troubles in the world can be put down to money—or\n",
      "the lack of it.”\n",
      "“which has been your particular trouble?” i asked.\n",
      "“i’ve enough for what i want. i’m one of the lucky ones.”\n",
      "“indeed.”\n",
      "“i’m not too flush just now, as a matter of fact. came into a legacy a\n",
      "year ago, and like a fool let myself be persuaded into putting it into\n",
      "some wild-cat scheme.”\n",
      "i sympathized, and narrated my own similar trouble.\n",
      "then the gong pealed out, and we all went in to lunch. poirot drew me\n",
      "back a little.\n",
      "“_eh! bien?_”\n",
      "“he’s all right,” i said. “i’m sure of it.”\n",
      "“nothing—disturbing?”\n",
      "“he had a legacy just a year ago,” i said. “but why not? why shouldn’t\n",
      "he? i’ll swear the man is perfectly square and aboveboard.”\n",
      "“without doubt, without doubt,” said poirot soothingly. “do not upset\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "he spoke as though to a fractious child.\n",
      "we all trooped into the dining-room. it seemed incredible that less\n",
      "than twenty-four hours had passed since i last sat at that table.\n",
      "afterwards, mrs. ackroyd took me aside and sat down with me on a sofa.\n",
      "“i can’t help feeling a little hurt,” she murmured, producing a\n",
      "handkerchief of the kind obviously not meant to be cried into. “hurt,\n",
      "i mean, by roger’s lack of confidence in me. that twenty thousand\n",
      "pounds ought to have been left to _me_—not to flora. a mother could be\n",
      "trusted to safeguard the interests of her child. a lack of trust, i\n",
      "call it.”\n",
      "“you forget, mrs. ackroyd,” i said, “flora was ackroyd’s own niece, a\n",
      "blood relation. it would have been different had you been his sister\n",
      "instead of his sister-in-law.”\n",
      "“as poor cecil’s widow, i think my feelings ought to have been\n",
      "considered,” said the lady, touching her eye-lashes gingerly with\n",
      "the handkerchief. “but roger was always most peculiar—not to say\n",
      "_mean_—about money matters. it has been a most difficult position\n",
      "for both flora and myself. he did not even give the poor child an\n",
      "allowance. he would pay her bills, you know, and even that with a good\n",
      "deal of reluctance and asking what she wanted all those fal-lals for—so\n",
      "like a man—but—now i’ve forgotten what it was i was going to say!\n",
      "oh, yes, not a penny we could call our own, you know. flora resented\n",
      "it—yes, i must say she resented it—very strongly. though devoted to\n",
      "her uncle, of course. but any girl would have resented it. yes, i must\n",
      "say roger had very strange ideas about money. he wouldn’t even buy new\n",
      "face towels, though i told him the old ones were in holes. and then,”\n",
      "proceeded mrs. ackroyd, with a sudden leap highly characteristic of\n",
      "her conversation, “to leave all that money—a thousand pounds—fancy, a\n",
      "thousand pounds!—to that woman.”\n",
      "“what woman?”\n",
      "“that russell woman. something very queer about her, and so i’ve always\n",
      "said. but roger wouldn’t hear a word against her. said she was a woman\n",
      "of great force of character, and that he admired and respected her.\n",
      "he was always going on about her rectitude and independence and moral\n",
      "worth. _i_ think there’s something fishy about her. she was certainly\n",
      "doing her best to marry roger. but i soon put a stop to that. she’s\n",
      "always hated me. naturally. _i_ saw through her.”\n",
      "i began to wonder if there was any chance of stemming mrs. ackroyd’s\n",
      "eloquence, and getting away.\n",
      "mr. hammond provided the necessary diversion by coming up to say\n",
      "good-by. i seized my chance and rose also.\n",
      "“about the inquest,” i said. “where would you prefer it to be held.\n",
      "here, or at the three boars?”\n",
      "mrs. ackroyd stared at me with a dropped jaw.\n",
      "“the inquest?” she asked, the picture of consternation. “but surely\n",
      "there won’t have to be an inquest?”\n",
      "mr. hammond gave a dry little cough and murmured, “inevitable. under\n",
      "the circumstances,” in two short little barks.\n",
      "“but surely dr. sheppard can arrange——”\n",
      "“there are limits to my powers of arrangement,” i said dryly.\n",
      "“if his death was an accident——”\n",
      "“he was murdered, mrs. ackroyd,” i said brutally.\n",
      "she gave a little cry.\n",
      "“no theory of accident will hold water for a minute.”\n",
      "mrs. ackroyd looked at me in distress. i had no patience with what i\n",
      "thought was her silly fear of unpleasantness.\n",
      "“if there’s an inquest, i—i shan’t have to answer questions and all\n",
      "that, shall i?” she asked.\n",
      "“i don’t know what will be necessary,” i answered. “i imagine\n",
      "mr. raymond will take the brunt of it off you. he knows all the\n",
      "circumstances, and can give formal evidence of identification.”\n",
      "the lawyer assented with a little bow.\n",
      "“i really don’t think there is anything to dread, mrs. ackroyd,” he\n",
      "said. “you will be spared all unpleasantness. now, as to the question\n",
      "of money, have you all you need for the present? i mean,” he added, as\n",
      "she looked at him inquiringly, “ready money. cash, you know. if not, i\n",
      "can arrange to let you have whatever you require.”\n",
      "“that ought to be all right,” said raymond, who was standing by. “mr.\n",
      "ackroyd cashed a cheque for a hundred pounds yesterday.”\n",
      "“a hundred pounds?”\n",
      "“yes. for wages and other expenses due to-day. at the moment it is\n",
      "still intact.”\n",
      "“where is this money? in his desk?”\n",
      "“no, he always kept his cash in his bedroom. in an old collar-box, to\n",
      "be accurate. funny idea, wasn’t it?”\n",
      "“i think,” said the lawyer, “we ought to make sure the money is there\n",
      "before i leave.”\n",
      "“certainly,” agreed the secretary. “i’ll take you up now.... oh! i\n",
      "forgot. the door’s locked.”\n",
      "inquiry from parker elicited the information that inspector raglan was\n",
      "in the housekeeper’s room asking a few supplementary questions. a few\n",
      "minutes later the inspector joined the party in the hall, bringing the\n",
      "key with him. he unlocked the door and we passed into the lobby and up\n",
      "the small staircase. at the top of the stairs the door into ackroyd’s\n",
      "bedroom stood open. inside the room it was dark, the curtains were\n",
      "drawn, and the bed was turned down just as it had been last night. the\n",
      "inspector drew the curtains, letting in the sunlight, and geoffrey\n",
      "raymond went to the top drawer of a rosewood bureau.\n",
      "“he kept his money like that, in an unlocked drawer. just fancy,”\n",
      "commented the inspector.\n",
      "the secretary flushed a little.\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd had perfect faith in the honesty of all the servants,” he\n",
      "said hotly.\n",
      "“oh! quite so,” said the inspector hastily.\n",
      "raymond opened the drawer, took out a round leather collar-box from the\n",
      "back of it, and opening it, drew out a thick wallet.\n",
      "“here is the money,” he said, taking out a fat roll of notes. “you\n",
      "will find the hundred intact, i know, for mr. ackroyd put it in the\n",
      "collar-box in my presence last night when he was dressing for dinner,\n",
      "and of course it has not been touched since.”\n",
      "mr. hammond took the roll from him and counted it. he looked up sharply.\n",
      "“a hundred pounds, you said. but there is only sixty here.”\n",
      "raymond stared at him.\n",
      "“impossible,” he cried, springing forward. taking the notes from the\n",
      "other’s hand, he counted them aloud.\n",
      "mr. hammond had been right. the total amounted to sixty pounds.\n",
      "“but—i can’t understand it,” cried the secretary, bewildered.\n",
      "poirot asked a question.\n",
      "“you saw mr. ackroyd put this money away last night when he was\n",
      "dressing for dinner? you are sure he had not paid away any of it\n",
      "already?”\n",
      "“i’m sure he hadn’t. he even said, ‘i don’t want to take a hundred\n",
      "pounds down to dinner with me. too bulgy.’”\n",
      "“then the affair is very simple,” remarked poirot. “either he paid out\n",
      "that forty pounds sometime last evening, or else it has been stolen.”\n",
      "“that’s the matter in a nutshell,” agreed the inspector. he turned\n",
      "to mrs. ackroyd. “which of the servants would come in here yesterday\n",
      "evening?”\n",
      "“i suppose the housemaid would turn down the bed.”\n",
      "“who is she? what do you know about her?”\n",
      "“she’s not been here very long,” said mrs. ackroyd. “but she’s a nice\n",
      "ordinary country girl.”\n",
      "“i think we ought to clear this matter up,” said the inspector. “if\n",
      "mr. ackroyd paid that money away himself, it may have a bearing on the\n",
      "mystery of the crime. the other servants all right, as far as you know?”\n",
      "“oh, i think so.”\n",
      "“not missed anything before?”\n",
      "“no.”\n",
      "“none of them leaving, or anything like that?”\n",
      "“the parlormaid is leaving.”\n",
      "“when?”\n",
      "“she gave notice yesterday, i believe.”\n",
      "“to you?”\n",
      "“oh, no. _i_ have nothing to do with the servants. miss russell attends\n",
      "to the household matters.”\n",
      "the inspector remained lost in thought for a minute or two. then he\n",
      "nodded his head and remarked, “i think i’d better have a word with miss\n",
      "russell, and i’ll see the girl dale as well.”\n",
      "poirot and i accompanied him to the housekeeper’s room. miss russell\n",
      "received us with her usual sang-froid.\n",
      "elsie dale had been at fernly five months. a nice girl, quick at her\n",
      "duties, and most respectable. good references. the last girl in the\n",
      "world to take anything not belonging to her.\n",
      "what about the parlormaid?\n",
      "“she, too, was a most superior girl. very quiet and ladylike. an\n",
      "excellent worker.”\n",
      "“then why is she leaving?” asked the inspector.\n",
      "miss russell pursed up her lips.\n",
      "“it was none of my doing. i understand mr. ackroyd found fault with\n",
      "her yesterday afternoon. it was her duty to do the study, and she\n",
      "disarranged some of the papers on his desk, i believe. he was very\n",
      "annoyed about it, and she gave notice. at least, that is what i\n",
      "understood from her, but perhaps you’d like to see her yourselves?”\n",
      "the inspector assented. i had already noticed the girl when she was\n",
      "waiting on us at lunch. a tall girl, with a lot of brown hair rolled\n",
      "tightly away at the back of her neck, and very steady gray eyes. she\n",
      "came in answer to the housekeeper’s summons, and stood very straight\n",
      "with those same gray eyes fixed on us.\n",
      "“you are ursula bourne?” asked the inspector.\n",
      "“yes, sir.”\n",
      "“i understand you are leaving?”\n",
      "“yes, sir.”\n",
      "“why is that?”\n",
      "“i disarranged some papers on mr. ackroyd’s desk. he was very angry\n",
      "about it, and i said i had better leave. he told me to go as soon as\n",
      "possible.”\n",
      "“were you in mr. ackroyd’s bedroom at all last night? tidying up or\n",
      "anything?”\n",
      "“no, sir. that is elsie’s work. i never went near that part of the\n",
      "house.”\n",
      "“i must tell you, my girl, that a large sum of money is missing from\n",
      "mr. ackroyd’s room.”\n",
      "at last i saw her roused. a wave of color swept over her face.\n",
      "“i know nothing about any money. if you think i took it, and that that\n",
      "is why mr. ackroyd dismissed me, you are wrong.”\n",
      "“i’m not accusing you of taking it, my girl,” said the inspector.\n",
      "“don’t flare up so.”\n",
      "the girl looked at him coldly.\n",
      "“you can search my things if you like,” she said disdainfully. “but you\n",
      "won’t find anything.”\n",
      "poirot suddenly interposed.\n",
      "“it was yesterday afternoon that mr. ackroyd dismissed you—or you\n",
      "dismissed yourself, was it not?” he asked.\n",
      "the girl nodded.\n",
      "“how long did the interview last?”\n",
      "“the interview?”\n",
      "“yes, the interview between you and mr. ackroyd in the study?”\n",
      "“i—i don’t know.”\n",
      "“twenty minutes? half an hour?”\n",
      "“something like that.”\n",
      "“not longer?”\n",
      "“not longer than half an hour, certainly.”\n",
      "“thank you, mademoiselle.”\n",
      "i looked curiously at him. he was rearranging a few objects on the\n",
      "table, setting them straight with precise fingers. his eyes were\n",
      "shining.\n",
      "“that’ll do,” said the inspector.\n",
      "ursula bourne disappeared. the inspector turned to miss russell.\n",
      "“how long has she been here? have you got a copy of the reference you\n",
      "had with her?”\n",
      "without answering the first question, miss russell moved to an adjacent\n",
      "bureau, opened one of the drawers, and took out a handful of letters\n",
      "clipped together with a patent fastener. she selected one and handed it\n",
      "to the inspector.\n",
      "“h’m,” said he. “reads all right. mrs. richard folliott, marby grange,\n",
      "marby. who’s this woman?”\n",
      "“quite good county people,” said miss russell.\n",
      "“well,” said the inspector, handing it back, “let’s have a look at the\n",
      "other one, elsie dale.”\n",
      "elsie dale was a big fair girl, with a pleasant but slightly stupid\n",
      "face. she answered our questions readily enough, and showed much\n",
      "distress and concern at the loss of the money.\n",
      "“i don’t think there’s anything wrong with her,” observed the\n",
      "inspector, after he had dismissed her.\n",
      "“what about parker?”\n",
      "miss russell pursed her lips together and made no reply.\n",
      "“i’ve a feeling there’s something wrong about that man,” the inspector\n",
      "continued thoughtfully. “the trouble is that i don’t quite see when he\n",
      "got his opportunity. he’d be busy with his duties immediately after\n",
      "dinner, and he’s got a pretty good alibi all through the evening. i\n",
      "know, for i’ve been devoting particular attention to it. well, thank\n",
      "you very much, miss russell. we’ll leave things as they are for the\n",
      "present. it’s highly probable mr. ackroyd paid that money away himself.”\n",
      "the housekeeper bade us a dry good-afternoon, and we took our leave.\n",
      "i left the house with poirot.\n",
      "“i wonder,” i said, breaking the silence, “what the papers the girl\n",
      "disarranged could have been for ackroyd to have got into such a state\n",
      "about them? i wonder if there is any clew there to the mystery.”\n",
      "“the secretary said there were no papers of particular importance on\n",
      "the desk,” said poirot quietly.\n",
      "“yes, but——” i paused.\n",
      "“it strikes you as odd that ackroyd should have flown into a rage about\n",
      "so trivial a matter?”\n",
      "“yes, it does rather.”\n",
      "“but was it a trivial matter?”\n",
      "“of course,” i admitted, “we don’t know what those papers may have\n",
      "been. but raymond certainly said——”\n",
      "“leave m. raymond out of it for a minute. what did you think of that\n",
      "girl?”\n",
      "“which girl? the parlormaid?”\n",
      "“yes, the parlormaid. ursula bourne.”\n",
      "“she seemed a nice girl,” i said hesitatingly.\n",
      "poirot repeated my words, but whereas i had laid a slight stress on the\n",
      "fourth word, he put it on the second.\n",
      "“she _seemed_ a nice girl—yes.”\n",
      "then, after a minute’s silence, he took something from his pocket and\n",
      "handed it to me.\n",
      "“see, my friend, i will show you something. look there.”\n",
      "the paper he had handed me was that compiled by the inspector and given\n",
      "by him to poirot that morning. following the pointing finger, i saw a\n",
      "small cross marked in pencil opposite the name ursula bourne.\n",
      "“you may not have noticed it at the time, my good friend, but there was\n",
      "one person on this list whose alibi had no kind of confirmation. ursula\n",
      "bourne.”\n",
      "“you don’t think——”\n",
      "“dr. sheppard, i dare to think anything. ursula bourne may have killed\n",
      "mr. ackroyd, but i confess i can see no motive for her doing so. can\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "he looked at me very hard—so hard that i felt uncomfortable.\n",
      "“can you?” he repeated.\n",
      "“no motive whatsoever,” i said firmly.\n",
      "his gaze relaxed. he frowned and murmured to himself:—\n",
      "“since the blackmailer was a man, it follows that she cannot be the\n",
      "blackmailer, then——”\n",
      "i coughed.\n",
      "“as far as that goes——” i began doubtfully.\n",
      "he spun round on me.\n",
      "“what? what are you going to say?”\n",
      "“nothing. nothing. only that, strictly speaking, mrs. ferrars in her\n",
      "letter mentioned a _person_—she didn’t actually specify a man. but we\n",
      "took it for granted, ackroyd and i, that it _was_ a man.”\n",
      "poirot did not seem to be listening to me. he was muttering to himself\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“but then it is possible after all—yes, certainly it is possible—but\n",
      "then—ah! i must rearrange my ideas. method, order; never have i needed\n",
      "them more. everything must fit in—in its appointed place—otherwise i am\n",
      "on the wrong tack.”\n",
      "he broke off, and whirled round upon me again.\n",
      "“where is marby?”\n",
      "“it’s on the other side of cranchester.”\n",
      "“how far away?”\n",
      "“oh!—fourteen miles, perhaps.”\n",
      "“would it be possible for you to go there? to-morrow, say?”\n",
      "“to-morrow? let me see, that’s sunday. yes, i could arrange it. what do\n",
      "you want me to do there?”\n",
      "“see this mrs. folliott. find out all you can about ursula bourne.”\n",
      "“very well. but—i don’t much care for the job.”\n",
      "“it is not the time to make difficulties. a man’s life may hang on\n",
      "this.”\n",
      "“poor ralph,” i said with a sigh. “you believe him to be innocent,\n",
      "though?”\n",
      "poirot looked at me very gravely.\n",
      "“do you want to know the truth?”\n",
      "“of course.”\n",
      "“then you shall have it. my friend, everything points to the assumption\n",
      "that he is guilty.”\n",
      "“what!” i exclaimed.\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“yes, that stupid inspector—for he is stupid—has everything pointing\n",
      "his way. i seek for the truth—and the truth leads me every time to\n",
      "ralph paton. motive, opportunity, means. but i will leave no stone\n",
      "unturned. i promised mademoiselle flora. and she was very sure, that\n",
      "little one. but very sure indeed.”\n",

      " poirot pays a call\n",
      "i was slightly nervous when i rang the bell at marby grange the\n",
      "following afternoon. i wondered very much what poirot expected to\n",
      "find out. he had entrusted the job to me. why? was it because, as\n",
      "in the case of questioning major blunt, he wished to remain in the\n",
      "background? the wish, intelligible in the first case, seemed to me\n",
      "quite meaningless here.\n",
      "my meditations were interrupted by the advent of a smart parlormaid.\n",
      "yes, mrs. folliott was at home. i was ushered into a big drawing-room,\n",
      "and looked round me curiously as i waited for the mistress of the\n",
      "house. a large bare room, some good bits of old china, and some\n",
      "beautiful etchings, shabby covers and curtains. a lady’s room in every\n",
      "sense of the term.\n",
      "i turned from the inspection of a bartolozzi on the wall as mrs.\n",
      "folliott came into the room. she was a tall woman, with untidy brown\n",
      "hair, and a very winning smile.\n",
      "“dr. sheppard,” she said hesitatingly.\n",
      "“that is my name,” i replied. “i must apologize for calling upon you\n",
      "like this, but i wanted some information about a parlormaid previously\n",
      "employed by you, ursula bourne.”\n",
      "with the utterance of the name the smile vanished from her face, and\n",
      "all the cordiality froze out of her manner. she looked uncomfortable\n",
      "and ill at ease.\n",
      "“ursula bourne?” she said hesitatingly.\n",
      "“yes,” i said. “perhaps you don’t remember the name?”\n",
      "“oh, yes, of course. i—i remember perfectly.”\n",
      "“she left you just over a year ago, i understand?”\n",
      "“yes. yes, she did. that is quite right.”\n",
      "“and you were satisfied with her whilst she was with you? how long was\n",
      "she with you, by the way?”\n",
      "“oh! a year or two—i can’t remember exactly how long. she—she is very\n",
      "capable. i’m sure you will find her quite satisfactory. i didn’t know\n",
      "she was leaving fernly. i hadn’t the least idea of it.”\n",
      "“can you tell me anything about her?” i asked.\n",
      "“anything about her?”\n",
      "“yes, where she comes from, who her people are—that sort of thing?”\n",
      "mrs. folliott’s face wore more than ever its frozen look.\n",
      "“i don’t know at all.”\n",
      "“who was she with before she came to you?”\n",
      "“i’m afraid i don’t remember.”\n",
      "there was a spark of anger now underlying her nervousness. she flung up\n",
      "her head in a gesture that was vaguely familiar.\n",
      "“is it really necessary to ask all these questions?”\n",
      "“not at all,” i said, with an air of surprise and a tinge of apology\n",
      "in my manner. “i had no idea you would mind answering them. i am very\n",
      "sorry.”\n",
      "her anger left her and she became confused again.\n",
      "“oh! i don’t mind answering them. i assure you i don’t. why should i?\n",
      "it—it just seemed a little odd, you know. that’s all. a little odd.”\n",
      "one advantage of being a medical practitioner is that you can usually\n",
      "tell when people are lying to you. i should have known from mrs.\n",
      "folliott’s manner, if from nothing else, that she did mind answering my\n",
      "questions—minded intensely. she was thoroughly uncomfortable and upset,\n",
      "and there was plainly some mystery in the background. i judged her to\n",
      "be a woman quite unused to deception of any kind, and consequently\n",
      "rendered acutely uneasy when forced to practice it. a child could have\n",
      "seen through her.\n",
      "but it was also clear that she had no intention of telling me anything\n",
      "further. whatever the mystery centering around ursula bourne might be,\n",
      "i was not going to learn it through mrs. folliott.\n",
      "defeated, i apologized once more for disturbing her, took my hat and\n",
      "departed.\n",
      "i went to see a couple of patients and arrived home about six o’clock.\n",
      "caroline was sitting beside the wreck of tea things. she had that\n",
      "look of suppressed exultation on her face which i know only too well.\n",
      "it is a sure sign with her, of either the getting or the giving of\n",
      "information. i wondered which it had been.\n",
      "“i’ve had a very interesting afternoon,” began caroline as i dropped\n",
      "into my own particular easy chair, and stretched out my feet to the\n",
      "inviting blaze in the fireplace.\n",
      "“have you?” i asked. “miss ganett drop in to tea?”\n",
      "miss ganett is one of the chief of our newsmongers.\n",
      "“guess again,” said caroline with intense complacency.\n",
      "i guessed several times, working slowly through all the members of\n",
      "caroline’s intelligence corps. my sister received each guess with\n",
      "a triumphant shake of the head. in the end she volunteered the\n",
      "information herself.\n",
      "“m. poirot!” she said. “now what do you think of that?”\n",
      "i thought a good many things of it, but i was careful not to say them\n",
      "to caroline.\n",
      "“why did he come?” i asked.\n",
      "“to see me, of course. he said that knowing my brother so well, he\n",
      "hoped he might be permitted to make the acquaintance of his charming\n",
      "sister—your charming sister, i’ve got mixed up, but you know what i\n",
      "mean.”\n",
      "“what did he talk about?” i asked.\n",
      "“he told me a lot about himself and his cases. you know that prince\n",
      "paul of mauretania—the one who’s just married a dancer?”\n",
      "“yes?”\n",
      "“i saw a most intriguing paragraph about her in society snippets the\n",
      "other day, hinting that she was really a russian grand duchess—one\n",
      "of the czar’s daughters who managed to escape from the bolsheviks.\n",
      "well, it seems that m. poirot solved a baffling murder mystery that\n",
      "threatened to involve them both. prince paul was beside himself with\n",
      "gratitude.”\n",
      "“did he give him an emerald tie pin the size of a plover’s egg?” i\n",
      "inquired sarcastically.\n",
      "“he didn’t mention it. why?”\n",
      "“nothing,” i said. “i thought it was always done. it is in detective\n",
      "fiction anyway. the super detective always has his rooms littered with\n",
      "rubies and pearls and emeralds from grateful royal clients.”\n",
      "“it’s very interesting to hear about these things from the inside,”\n",
      "said my sister complacently.\n",
      "it would be—to caroline. i could not but admire the ingenuity of m.\n",
      "hercule poirot, who had selected unerringly the case of all others that\n",
      "would most appeal to an elderly maiden lady living in a small village.\n",
      "“did he tell you if the dancer was really a grand duchess?” i inquired.\n",
      "“he was not at liberty to speak,” said caroline importantly.\n",
      "i wondered how far poirot had strained the truth in talking to\n",
      "caroline—probably not at all. he had conveyed his innuendoes by means\n",
      "of his eyebrows and his shoulders.\n",
      "“and after all this,” i remarked, “i suppose you were ready to eat out\n",
      "of his hand.”\n",

      "think, to-night.”\n",
      "to see me in my own home, you would never imagine that i was a doctor\n",
      "of medicine. caroline does the home prescribing both for herself and me.\n",
      "“damn my liver,” i said irritably. “did you talk about the murder at\n",
      "all?”\n",
      "“well, naturally, james. what else is there to talk about locally?\n",
      "i was able to set m. poirot right upon several points. he was very\n",
      "grateful to me. he said i had the makings of a born detective in me—and\n",
      "a wonderful psychological insight into human nature.”\n",
      "caroline was exactly like a cat that is full to overflowing with rich\n",
      "cream. she was positively purring.\n",
      "“he talked a lot about the little gray cells of the brain, and of their\n",
      "functions. his own, he says, are of the first quality.”\n",
      "“he would say so,” i remarked bitterly. “modesty is certainly not his\n",
      "middle name.”\n",
      "“i wish you would not be so horribly american, james. he thought it\n",
      "very important that ralph should be found as soon as possible, and\n",
      "induced to come forward and give an account of himself. he says that\n",
      "his disappearance will produce a very unfortunate impression at the\n",
      "inquest.”\n",
      "“and what did you say to that?”\n",
      "“i agreed with him,” said caroline importantly. “and i was able to tell\n",
      "him the way people were already talking about it.”\n",
      "“caroline,” i said sharply, “did you tell m. poirot what you overheard\n",
      "in the wood that day?”\n",
      "“i did,” said caroline complacently.\n",
      "i got up and began to walk about.\n",
      "“you realize what you’re doing, i hope,” i jerked out. “you’re putting\n",
      "a halter round ralph paton’s neck as surely as you’re sitting in that\n",
      "chair.”\n",
      "“not at all,” said caroline, quite unruffled. “i was surprised _you_\n",
      "hadn’t told him.”\n",
      "“i took very good care not to,” i said. “i’m fond of that boy.”\n",
      "“so am i. that’s why i say you’re talking nonsense. i don’t believe\n",
      "ralph did it, and so the truth can’t hurt him, and we ought to give m.\n",
      "poirot all the help we can. why, think, very likely ralph was out with\n",
      "that identical girl on the night of the murder, and if so, he’s got a\n",
      "perfect alibi.”\n",
      "“if he’s got a perfect alibi,” i retorted, “why doesn’t he come forward\n",
      "and say so?”\n",
      "“might get the girl into trouble,” said caroline sapiently. “but if m.\n",
      "poirot gets hold of her, and puts it to her as her duty, she’ll come\n",
      "forward of her own accord and clear ralph.”\n",
      "“you seem to have invented a romantic fairy story of your own,” i said.\n",
      "“you read too many trashy novels, caroline. i’ve always told you so.”\n",
      "i dropped into my chair again.\n",
      "“did poirot ask you any more questions?” i inquired.\n",
      "“only about the patients you had that morning.”\n",
      "“the patients?” i demanded, unbelievingly.\n",
      "“yes, your surgery patients. how many and who they were?”\n",
      "“do you mean to say you were able to tell him that?” i demanded.\n",
      "caroline is really amazing.\n",
      "“why not?” asked my sister triumphantly. “i can see the path up to the\n",
      "surgery door perfectly from this window. and i’ve got an excellent\n",
      "memory, james. much better than yours, let me tell you.”\n",
      "“i’m sure you have,” i murmured mechanically.\n",
      "my sister went on, checking the names on her fingers.\n",
      "“there was old mrs. bennett, and that boy from the farm with the bad\n",
      "finger, dolly grice to have a needle out of her finger; that american\n",
      "steward off the liner. let me see—that’s four. yes, and old george\n",
      "evans with his ulcer. and lastly——”\n",
      "she paused significantly.\n",
      "“well?”\n",
      "caroline brought out her climax triumphantly. she hissed in the most\n",
      "approved style—aided by the fortunate number of s’s at her disposal.\n",
      "“_miss russell!_”\n",
      "she sat back in her chair and looked at me meaningly, and when caroline\n",
      "looks at you meaningly, it is impossible to miss it.\n",
      "“i don’t know what you mean,” i said, quite untruthfully. “why\n",
      "shouldn’t miss russell consult me about her bad knee?”\n",
      "“bad knee,” said caroline. “fiddlesticks! no more bad knee than you and\n",
      "i. she was after something else.”\n",
      "“what?” i asked.\n",
      "caroline had to admit that she didn’t know.\n",
      "“but depend upon it, that was what he was trying to get at, m. poirot,\n",
      "i mean. there’s something fishy about that woman, and he knows it.”\n",
      "“precisely the remark mrs. ackroyd made to me yesterday,” i said. “that\n",
      "there was something fishy about miss russell.”\n",
      "“ah!” said caroline darkly, “mrs. ackroyd! there’s another!”\n",
      "“another what?”\n",
      "caroline refused to explain her remarks. she merely nodded her head\n",
      "several times, rolled up her knitting, and went upstairs to don the\n",
      "high mauve silk blouse and the gold locket which she calls dressing for\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "i stayed there staring into the fire and thinking over caroline’s\n",
      "words. had poirot really come to gain information about miss russell,\n",
      "or was it only caroline’s tortuous mind that interpreted everything\n",
      "according to her own ideas?\n",
      "there had certainly been nothing in miss russell’s manner that morning\n",
      "to arouse suspicion. at least——\n",
      "i remembered her persistent conversation on the subject of drug-taking\n",
      "and from that she had led the conversation to poisons and poisoning.\n",
      "but there was nothing in that. ackroyd had not been poisoned. still, it\n",
      "was odd....\n",
      "i heard caroline’s voice, rather acid in note, calling from the top of\n",
      "the stairs.\n",
      "“james, you will be late for dinner.”\n",
      "i put some coal on the fire and went upstairs obediently.\n",

      "a joint inquest was held on monday.\n",
      "i do not propose to give the proceedings in detail. to do so would only\n",
      "be to go over the same ground again and again. by arrangement with the\n",
      "police, very little was allowed to come out. i gave evidence as to the\n",
      "cause of ackroyd’s death and the probable time. the absence of ralph\n",
      "paton was commented on by the coroner, but not unduly stressed.\n",
      "afterwards, poirot and i had a few words with inspector raglan. the\n",
      "inspector was very grave.\n",
      "“it looks bad, mr. poirot,” he said. “i’m trying to judge the thing\n",
      "fair and square. i’m a local man, and i’ve seen captain paton many\n",
      "times in cranchester. i’m not wanting him to be the guilty one—but it’s\n",
      "bad whichever way you look at it. if he’s innocent, why doesn’t he come\n",
      "forward? we’ve got evidence against him, but it’s just possible that\n",
      "that evidence could be explained away. then why doesn’t he give an\n",
      "explanation?”\n",
      "a lot more lay behind the inspector’s words than i knew at the time.\n",
      "ralph’s description had been wired to every port and railway station\n",
      "in england. the police everywhere were on the alert. his rooms in town\n",
      "were watched, and any houses he had been known to be in the habit\n",
      "of frequenting. with such a _cordon_ it seemed impossible that ralph\n",
      "should be able to evade detection. he had no luggage, and, as far as\n",
      "any one knew, no money.\n",
      "“i can’t find any one who saw him at the station that night,” continued\n",
      "the inspector. “and yet he’s well known down here, and you’d think\n",
      "somebody would have noticed him. there’s no news from liverpool either.”\n",
      "“you think he went to liverpool?” queried poirot.\n",
      "“well, it’s on the cards. that telephone message from the station,\n",
      "just three minutes before the liverpool express left—there ought to be\n",
      "something in that.”\n",
      "“unless it was deliberately intended to throw you off the scent. that\n",
      "might just possibly be the point of the telephone message.”\n",
      "“that’s an idea,” said the inspector eagerly. “do you really think\n",
      "that’s the explanation of the telephone call?”\n",
      "“my friend,” said poirot gravely, “i do not know. but i will tell you\n",
      "this: i believe that when we find the explanation of that telephone\n",
      "call we shall find the explanation of the murder.”\n",
      "“you said something like that before, i remember,” i observed, looking\n",
      "at him curiously.\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“i always come back to it,” he said seriously.\n",
      "“it seems to me utterly irrelevant,” i declared.\n",
      "“i wouldn’t say that,” demurred the inspector. “but i must confess i\n",
      "think mr. poirot here harps on it a little too much. we’ve better clews\n",
      "than that. the fingerprints on the dagger, for instance.”\n",
      "poirot became suddenly very foreign in manner, as he often did when\n",
      "excited over anything.\n",
      "“m. l’inspecteur,” he said, “beware of the blind—the blind—_comment\n",
      "dire?_—the little street that has no end to it.”\n",
      "inspector raglan stared, but i was quicker.\n",
      "“you mean a blind alley?” i said.\n",
      "“that is it—the blind street that leads nowhere. so it may be with\n",
      "those fingerprints—they may lead you nowhere.”\n",
      "“i don’t see how that can well be,” said the police officer. “i suppose\n",
      "you’re hinting that they’re faked? i’ve read of such things being done,\n",
      "though i can’t say i’ve ever come across it in my experience. but fake\n",
      "or true—they’re bound to lead _somewhere_.”\n",
      "poirot merely shrugged his shoulders, flinging out his arms wide.\n",
      "the inspector then showed us various enlarged photographs of the\n",
      "fingerprints, and proceeded to become technical on the subject of loops\n",
      "and whorls.\n",
      "“come now,” he said at last, annoyed by poirot’s detached manner,\n",
      "“you’ve got to admit that those prints were made by some one who was in\n",
      "the house that night?”\n",
      "“_bien entendu_,” said poirot, nodding his head.\n",
      "“well, i’ve taken the prints of every member of the household, every\n",
      "one, mind you, from the old lady down to the kitchenmaid.”\n",
      "i don’t think mrs. ackroyd would enjoy being referred to as the old\n",
      "lady. she must spend a considerable amount on cosmetics.\n",
      "“every one’s,” repeated the inspector fussily.\n",
      "“including mine,” i said dryly.\n",
      "“very well. none of them correspond. that leaves us two alternatives.\n",
      "ralph paton, or the mysterious stranger the doctor here tells us about.\n",
      "when we get hold of those two——”\n",
      "“much valuable time may have been lost,” broke in poirot.\n",
      "“i don’t quite get you, mr. poirot?”\n",
      "“you have taken the prints of every one in the house, you say,”\n",
      "murmured poirot. “is that the exact truth you are telling me there, m.\n",
      "l’inspecteur?”\n",
      "“certainly.”\n",
      "“without overlooking any one?”\n",
      "“without overlooking any one.”\n",
      "“the quick or the dead?”\n",
      "for a moment the inspector looked bewildered at what he took to be a\n",
      "religious observation. then he reacted slowly.\n",
      "“you mean——”\n",
      "“the dead, m. l’inspecteur.”\n",
      "the inspector still took a minute or two to understand.\n",
      "“i am suggesting,” said poirot placidly, “that the fingerprints on the\n",
      "dagger handle are those of mr. ackroyd himself. it is an easy matter to\n",
      "verify. his body is still available.”\n",
      "“but why? what would be the point of it? you’re surely not suggesting\n",
      "suicide, mr. poirot?”\n",
      "“ah! no. my theory is that the murderer wore gloves or wrapped\n",
      "something round his hand. after the blow was struck, he picked up the\n",
      "victim’s hand and closed it round the dagger handle.”\n",
      "“but why?”\n",
      "poirot shrugged his shoulders again.\n",
      "“to make a confusing case even more confusing.”\n",
      "“well,” said the inspector, “i’ll look into it. what gave you the idea\n",
      "in the first place?”\n",
      "“when you were so kind as to show me the dagger and draw attention to\n",
      "the fingerprints. i know very little of loops and whorls—see, i confess\n",
      "my ignorance frankly. but it did occur to me that the position of the\n",
      "prints was somewhat awkward. not so would i have held a dagger in order\n",
      "to strike. naturally, with the right hand brought up over the shoulder\n",
      "backwards, it would have been difficult to put it in exactly the right\n",
      "position.”\n",
      "inspector raglan stared at the little man. poirot, with an air of great\n",
      "unconcern, flecked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve.\n",
      "“well,” said the inspector, “it’s an idea. i’ll look into it all right,\n",
      "but don’t you be disappointed if nothing comes of it.”\n",
      "he endeavored to make his tone kindly and patronizing. poirot watched\n",
      "him go off. then he turned to me with twinkling eyes.\n",
      "“another time,” he observed, “i must be more careful of his _amour\n",
      "propre_. and now that we are left to our own devices, what do you\n",
      "think, my good friend, of a little reunion of the family?”\n",
      "the “little reunion,” as poirot called it, took place about half an\n",
      "hour later. we sat round the table in the dining-room at fernly—poirot\n",
      "at the head of the table, like the chairman of some ghastly board\n",
      "meeting. the servants were not present, so we were six in all. mrs.\n",
      "ackroyd, flora, major blunt, young raymond, poirot, and myself.\n",
      "when every one was assembled, poirot rose and bowed.\n",
      "“messieurs, mesdames, i have called you together for a certain\n",
      "purpose.” he paused. “to begin with, i want to make a very special plea\n",
      "to mademoiselle.”\n",
      "“to me?” said flora.\n",
      "“mademoiselle, you are engaged to captain ralph paton. if any one\n",
      "is in his confidence, you are. i beg you, most earnestly, if you\n",
      "know of his whereabouts, to persuade him to come forward. one little\n",
      "minute”—as flora raised her head to speak—“say nothing till you have\n",
      "well reflected. mademoiselle, his position grows daily more dangerous.\n",
      "if he had come forward at once, no matter how damning the facts, he\n",
      "might have had a chance of explaining them away. but this silence—this\n",
      "flight—what can it mean? surely only one thing, knowledge of guilt.\n",
      "mademoiselle, if you really believe in his innocence, persuade him to\n",
      "come forward before it is too late.”\n",
      "flora’s face had gone very white.\n",
      "“too late!” she repeated, very low.\n",
      "poirot leant forward, looking at her.\n",
      "“see now, mademoiselle,” he said very gently, “it is papa poirot who\n",
      "asks you this. the old papa poirot who has much knowledge and much\n",
      "experience. i would not seek to entrap you, mademoiselle. will you not\n",
      "trust me—and tell me where ralph paton is hiding?”\n",
      "the girl rose, and stood facing him.\n",
      "“m. poirot,” she said in a clear voice, “i swear to you—swear\n",
      "solemnly—that i have no idea where ralph is, and that i have neither\n",
      "seen him nor heard from him either on the day of—of the murder, or\n",
      "since.”\n",
      "she sat down again. poirot gazed at her in silence for a minute or two,\n",
      "then he brought his hand down on the table with a sharp rap.\n",
      "“_bien!_ that is that,” he said. his face hardened. “now i appeal to\n",
      "these others who sit round this table, mrs. ackroyd, major blunt, dr.\n",
      "sheppard, mr. raymond. you are all friends and intimates of the missing\n",
      "man. if you know where ralph paton is hiding, speak out.”\n",
      "there was a long silence. poirot looked to each in turn.\n",
      "“i beg of you,” he said in a low voice, “speak out.”\n",
      "but still there was silence, broken at last by mrs. ackroyd.\n",
      "“i must say,” she observed in a plaintive voice, “that ralph’s absence\n",
      "is most peculiar—most peculiar indeed. not to come forward at such a\n",
      "time. it looks, you know, as though there were something _behind_ it.\n",
      "i can’t help thinking, flora dear, that it was a very fortunate thing\n",
      "your engagement was never formally announced.”\n",
      "“mother!” cried flora angrily.\n",
      "“providence,” declared mrs. ackroyd. “i have a devout belief in\n",
      "providence—a divinity that shapes our ends, as shakespeare’s beautiful\n",
      "line runs.”\n",
      "“surely you don’t make the almighty directly responsible for\n",
      "thick ankles, mrs. ackroyd, do you?” asked geoffrey raymond, his\n",
      "irresponsible laugh ringing out.\n",
      "his idea was, i think, to loosen the tension, but mrs. ackroyd threw\n",
      "him a glance of reproach and took out her handkerchief.\n",
      "“flora has been saved a terrible amount of notoriety and\n",
      "unpleasantness. not for a moment that i think dear ralph had anything\n",
      "to do with poor roger’s death. i _don’t_ think so. but then i have a\n",
      "trusting heart—i always have had, ever since a child. i am loath to\n",
      "believe the worst of any one. but, of course, one must remember that\n",
      "ralph was in several air raids as a young boy. the results are apparent\n",
      "long after, sometimes, they say. people are not responsible for their\n",
      "actions in the least. they lose control, you know, without being able\n",
      "to help it.”\n",
      "“mother,” cried flora, “you don’t think ralph did it?”\n",
      "“come, mrs. ackroyd,” said blunt.\n",
      "“i don’t know what to think,” said mrs. ackroyd tearfully. “it’s all\n",
      "very upsetting. what would happen to the estate, i wonder, if ralph\n",
      "were found guilty?”\n",
      "raymond pushed his chair away from the table violently. major blunt\n",
      "remained very quiet, looking thoughtfully at her. “like shell-shock,\n",
      "you know,” said mrs. ackroyd obstinately, “and i dare say roger kept\n",
      "him very short of money—with the best intentions, of course. i can see\n",
      "you are all against me, but i do think it is very odd that ralph has\n",
      "not come forward, and i must say i am thankful flora’s engagement was\n",
      "never announced formally.”\n",
      "“it will be to-morrow,” said flora in a clear voice.\n",
      "“flora!” cried her mother, aghast.\n",
      "flora had turned to the secretary.\n",
      "“will you send the announcement to the _morning post_ and the _times_,\n",
      "please, mr. raymond.”\n",
      "“if you are sure that it is wise, miss ackroyd,” he replied gravely.\n",
      "she turned impulsively to blunt.\n",
      "“you understand,” she said. “what else can i do? as things are, i must\n",
      "stand by ralph. don’t you see that i must?”\n",
      "she looked very searchingly at him, and after a long pause he nodded\n",
      "abruptly.\n",
      "mrs. ackroyd burst out into shrill protests. flora remained unmoved.\n",
      "then raymond spoke.\n",
      "“i appreciate your motives, miss ackroyd. but don’t you think you’re\n",
      "being rather precipitate? wait a day or two.”\n",
      "“to-morrow,” said flora, in a clear voice. “it’s no good, mother, going\n",
      "on like this. whatever else i am, i’m not disloyal to my friends.”\n",
      "“m. poirot,” mrs. ackroyd appealed tearfully, “can’t you say anything\n",
      "at all?”\n",
      "“nothing to be said,” interpolated blunt. “she’s doing the right thing.\n",
      "i’ll stand by her through thick and thin.”\n",
      "flora held out her hand to him.\n",
      "“thank you, major blunt,” she said.\n",
      "“mademoiselle,” said poirot, “will you let an old man congratulate you\n",
      "on your courage and your loyalty? and will you not misunderstand me if\n",
      "i ask you—ask you most solemnly—to postpone the announcement you speak\n",
      "of for at least two days more?”\n",
      "flora hesitated.\n",
      "“i ask it in ralph paton’s interests as much as in yours, mademoiselle.\n",
      "you frown. you do not see how that can be. but i assure you that it\n",
      "is so. _pas de blagues_. you put the case into my hands—you must not\n",
      "hamper me now.”\n",
      "flora paused a few minutes before replying.\n",
      "“i do not like it,” she said at last, “but i will do what you say.”\n",
      "she sat down again at the table.\n",
      "“and now, messieurs et mesdames,” said poirot rapidly, “i will continue\n",
      "with what i was about to say. understand this, i mean to arrive at\n",
      "the truth. the truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and\n",
      "beautiful to the seeker after it. i am much aged, my powers may not\n",
      "be what they were.” here he clearly expected a contradiction. “in all\n",
      "probability this is the last case i shall ever investigate. but hercule\n",
      "poirot does not end with a failure. messieurs et mesdames, i tell you,\n",
      "i mean to _know_. and i shall know—in spite of you all.”\n",
      "he brought out the last words provocatively, hurling them in our face\n",
      "as it were. i think we all flinched back a little, excepting geoffrey\n",
      "raymond, who remained good humored and imperturbable as usual.\n",
      "“how do you mean—in spite of us all?” he asked, with slightly raised\n",
      "eyebrows.\n",
      "“but—just that, monsieur. every one of you in this room is concealing\n",
      "something from me.” he raised his hand as a faint murmur of protest\n",

      "he held out to me the little quill. i looked at it curiously. then a\n",
      "memory of something i had read stirred in me.\n",

      "curiously.\n",
      "“my friend the inspector took it for granted that any one using that\n",
      "path did so as a short cut to the house, but as soon as i saw the\n",
      "summer-house, i realized that the same path would be taken by any one\n",
      "using the summer-house as a rendezvous. now it seems fairly certain\n",
      "that the stranger came neither to the front nor to the back door. then\n",
      "did some one from the house go out and meet him? if so, what could be a\n",
      "more convenient place than that little summer-house? i searched it with\n",
      "the hope that i might find some clew inside. i found two, the scrap of\n",
      "cambric and the quill.”\n",
      "“and the scrap of cambric?” i asked curiously. “what about that?”\n",

      "“not very obvious to me.” i changed the subject. “anyway,” i said,\n",
      "“this man went to the summer-house to meet somebody. who was that\n",
      "somebody?”\n",
      "“exactly the question,” said poirot. “you will remember that mrs.\n",
      "ackroyd and her daughter came over from canada to live here?”\n",
      "“is that what you meant to-day when you accused them of hiding the\n",
      "truth?”\n",
      "“perhaps. now another point. what did you think of the parlormaid’s\n",
      "story?”\n",
      "“what story?”\n",
      "“the story of her dismissal. does it take half an hour to dismiss a\n",
      "servant? was the story of those important papers a likely one? and\n",
      "remember, though she says she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until\n",
      "ten o’clock, there is no one to confirm her statement.”\n",
      "“you bewilder me,” i said.\n",
      "“to me it grows clearer. but tell me now your own ideas and theories.”\n",
      "i drew a piece of paper from my pocket.\n",
      "“i just scribbled down a few suggestions,” i said apologetically.\n",
      "“but excellent—you have method. let us hear them.”\n",
      "i read out in a somewhat embarrassed voice.\n",
      "“to begin with, one must look at the thing logically——”\n",
      "“just what my poor hastings used to say,” interrupted poirot, “but\n",
      "alas! he never did so.”\n",
      "“_point no. 1._—mr. ackroyd was heard talking to some one at half-past\n",
      "nine.\n",
      "“_point no. 2._—at some time during the evening ralph paton must have\n",
      "come in through the window, as evidenced by the prints of his shoes.\n",
      "“_point no. 3._—mr. ackroyd was nervous that evening, and would only\n",

      "for money. we know ralph paton was in a scrape.\n",
      "“_these four points go to show that the person with mr. ackroyd at\n",
      "nine-thirty was ralph paton. but we know that mr. ackroyd was alive at\n",
      "a quarter to ten, therefore it was not ralph who killed him. ralph left\n",
      "the window open. afterwards the murderer came in that way._”\n",
      "“and who was the murderer?” inquired poirot.\n",
      "“the american stranger. he may have been in league with parker, and\n",
      "possibly in parker we have the man who blackmailed mrs. ferrars. if\n",
      "so, parker may have heard enough to realize the game was up, have told\n",
      "his accomplice so, and the latter did the crime with the dagger which\n",
      "parker gave him.”\n",
      "“it is a theory that,” admitted poirot. “decidedly you have cells of a\n",
      "kind. but it leaves a good deal unaccounted for.”\n",
      "“such as——?”\n",
      "“the telephone call, the pushed-out chair——”\n",
      "“do you really think the latter important?” i interrupted.\n",
      "“perhaps not,” admitted my friend. “it may have been pulled out\n",
      "by accident, and raymond or blunt may have shoved it into place\n",
      "unconsciously under the stress of emotion. then there is the missing\n",
      "forty pounds.”\n",
      "“given by ackroyd to ralph,” i suggested. “he may have reconsidered his\n",
      "first refusal.”\n",

      "“why was blunt so certain in his own mind that it was raymond with mr.\n",
      "ackroyd at nine-thirty?”\n",
      "“he explained that,” i said.\n",
      "“you think so? i will not press the point. tell me instead, what were\n",
      "ralph paton’s reasons for disappearing?”\n",
      "“that’s rather more difficult,” i said slowly. “i shall have to speak\n",
      "as a medical man. ralph’s nerves must have gone phut! if he suddenly\n",
      "found out that his uncle had been murdered within a few minutes of his\n",
      "leaving him—after, perhaps, a rather stormy interview—well, he might\n",
      "get the wind up and clear right out. men have been known to do that—act\n",
      "guiltily when they’re perfectly innocent.”\n",
      "“yes, that is true,” said poirot. “but we must not lose sight of one\n",

      "“i know what you’re going to say,” i remarked: “motive. ralph paton\n",
      "inherits a great fortune by his uncle’s death.”\n",
      "“that is one motive,” agreed poirot.\n",
      "“one?”\n",
      "“_mais oui._ do you realize that there are three separate motives\n",
      "staring us in the face. somebody certainly stole the blue envelope and\n",
      "its contents. that is one motive. blackmail! ralph paton may have been\n",
      "the man who blackmailed mrs. ferrars. remember, as far as hammond\n",
      "knew, ralph paton had not applied to his uncle for help of late. that\n",
      "looks as though he were being supplied with money elsewhere. then there\n",
      "is the fact that he was in some—how do you say—scrape?—which he feared\n",
      "might get to his uncle’s ears. and finally there is the one you have\n",
      "just mentioned.”\n",
      "“dear me,” i said, rather taken aback. “the case does seem black\n",
      "against him.”\n",
      "“does it?” said poirot. “that is where we disagree, you and i. three\n",
      "motives—it is almost too much. i am inclined to believe that, after\n",
      "all, ralph paton is innocent.”\n",
      " chapter xiv\n",
      " mrs. ackroyd\n",
      "after the evening talk i have just chronicled, the affair seemed to\n",
      "me to enter on a different phase. the whole thing can be divided into\n",
      "two parts, each clear and distinct from the other. part i. ranges from\n",
      "ackroyd’s death on the friday evening to the following monday night.\n",
      "it is the straight-forward narrative of what occurred, as presented\n",
      "to hercule poirot. i was at poirot’s elbow the whole time. i saw what\n",
      "he saw. i tried my best to read his mind. as i know now, i failed in\n",
      "this latter task. though poirot showed me all his discoveries—as, for\n",
      "instance, the gold wedding-ring—he held back the vital and yet logical\n",
      "impressions that he formed. as i came to know later, this secrecy was\n",
      "characteristic of him. he would throw out hints and suggestions, but\n",
      "beyond that he would not go.\n",
      "as i say, up till the monday evening, my narrative might have been that\n",
      "of poirot himself. i played watson to his sherlock. but after monday\n",
      "our ways diverged. poirot was busy on his own account. i got to hear\n",
      "of what he was doing, because, in king’s abbot, you get to hear of\n",
      "everything, but he did not take me into his confidence beforehand. and\n",
      "i, too, had my own preoccupations.\n",
      "on looking back, the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal\n",
      "character of this period. every one had a hand in the elucidation of\n",
      "the mystery. it was rather like a jig-saw puzzle to which every one\n",
      "contributed their own little piece of knowledge or discovery. but their\n",
      "task ended there. to poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those\n",
      "pieces into their correct place.\n",
      "some of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning.\n",
      "there was, for instance, the question of the black boots. but that\n",
      "comes later.... to take things strictly in chronological order, i must\n",
      "begin with the summons from mrs. ackroyd.\n",
      "she sent for me early on tuesday morning, and since the summons sounded\n",
      "an urgent one, i hastened there, expecting to find her _in extremis_.\n",
      "the lady was in bed. so much did she concede to the etiquette of the\n",
      "situation. she gave me her bony hand, and indicated a chair drawn up to\n",
      "the bedside.\n",
      "“well, mrs. ackroyd,” i said, “and what’s the matter with you?”\n",
      "i spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected\n",
      "of general practitioners.\n",
      "“i’m prostrated,” said mrs. ackroyd in a faint voice. “absolutely\n",

      "a straight-forward course on any subject. she always approaches her\n",

      "you don’t repeat every little detail to the police, do you? there are\n",

      "“and the tone altered—became quite abusive. i assure you, doctor,\n",
      "i was becoming a nervous wreck. i couldn’t sleep at nights. and a\n",
      "dreadful fluttering round the heart. and then i got a letter from a\n",
      "scotch gentleman—as a matter of fact there were two letters—both scotch\n",
      "gentlemen. mr. bruce macpherson was one, and the other were colin\n",
      "macdonald. quite a coincidence.”\n",
      "“hardly that,” i said dryly. “they are usually scotch gentlemen, but i\n",
      "suspect a semitic strain in their ancestry.”\n",
      "“ten pounds to ten thousand on note of hand alone,” murmured mrs.\n",
      "ackroyd reminiscently. “i wrote to one of them, but it seemed there\n",
      "were difficulties.”\n",
      "she paused.\n",
      "i gathered that we were just coming to delicate ground. i have never\n",
      "known any one more difficult to bring to the point.\n",
      "“you see,” murmured mrs. ackroyd, “it’s all a question of expectations,\n",
      "isn’t it? testamentary expectations. and though, of course, i expected\n",
      "that roger would provide for me, i didn’t _know_. i thought that if\n",
      "only i could glance over a copy of his will—not in any sense of vulgar\n",
      "prying—but just so that i could make my own arrangements.”\n",
      "she glanced sideways at me. the position was now very delicate indeed.\n",
      "fortunately words, ingeniously used, will serve to mask the ugliness of\n",
      "naked facts.\n",
      "“i could only tell this to you, dear dr. sheppard,” said mrs. ackroyd\n",
      "rapidly. “i can trust you not to misjudge me, and to represent the\n",
      "matter in the right light to m. poirot. it was on friday afternoon——”\n",
      "she came to a stop and swallowed uncertainly.\n",
      "“yes,” i repeated encouragingly. “on friday afternoon. well?”\n",
      "“every one was out, or so i thought. and i went into roger’s study—i\n",
      "had some real reason for going there—i mean, there was nothing\n",
      "underhand about it. and as i saw all the papers heaped on the desk, it\n",
      "just came to me, like a flash: ‘i wonder if roger keeps his will in\n",
      "one of the drawers of the desk.’ i’m so impulsive, always was, from a\n",
      "child. i do things on the spur of the moment. he’d left his keys—very\n",
      "careless of him—in the lock of the top drawer.”\n",
      "“i see,” i said helpfully. “so you searched the desk. did you find the\n",
      "will?”\n",
      "mrs. ackroyd gave a little scream, and i realized that i had not been\n",
      "sufficiently diplomatic.\n",
      "“how dreadful it sounds. but it wasn’t at all like that really.”\n",
      "“of course it wasn’t,” i said hastily. “you must forgive my unfortunate\n",
      "way of putting things.”\n",
      "“you see, men are so peculiar. in dear roger’s place, i should not\n",
      "have objected to revealing the provisions of my will. but men are so\n",
      "secretive. one is forced to adopt little subterfuges in self-defence.”\n",
      "“and the result of the little subterfuge?” i asked.\n",
      "“that’s just what i’m telling you. as i got to the bottom drawer,\n",
      "bourne came in. most awkward. of course i shut the drawer and stood\n",
      "up, and i called her attention to a few specks of dust on the surface.\n",
      "but i didn’t like the way she looked—quite respectful in manner, but a\n",
      "very nasty light in her eyes. almost contemptuous, if you know what i\n",
      "mean. i never have liked that girl very much. she’s a good servant, and\n",
      "she says ma’am, and doesn’t object to wearing caps and aprons (which\n",
      "i declare to you a lot of them do nowadays), and she can say ‘not at\n",
      "home’ without scruples if she has to answer the door instead of parker,\n",
      "and she doesn’t have those peculiar gurgling noises inside which so\n",
      "many parlormaids seem to have when they wait at table——let me see,\n",
      "where was i?”\n",
      "“you were saying, that in spite of several valuable qualities, you\n",
      "never liked bourne.”\n",
      "“no more i do. she’s—odd. there’s something different about her from\n",
      "the others. too well educated, that’s my opinion. you can’t tell who\n",
      "are ladies and who aren’t nowadays.”\n",
      "“and what happened next?” i asked.\n",
      "“nothing. at least, roger came in. and i thought he was out for a\n",
      "walk. and he said: ‘what’s all this?’ and i said, ‘nothing. i just came\n",
      "in to fetch _punch_.’ and i took _punch_ and went out with it. bourne\n",
      "stayed behind. i heard her asking roger if she could speak to him for a\n",
      "minute. i went straight up to my room, to lie down. i was very upset.”\n",
      "there was a pause.\n",
      "“you will explain to m. poirot, won’t you? you can see for yourself\n",
      "what a trivial matter the whole thing was. but, of course, when he was\n",
      "so stern about concealing things, i thought of this at once. bourne\n",
      "may have made some extraordinary story out of it, but you can explain,\n",
      "can’t you?”\n",
      "“that is all?” i said. “you have told me everything?”\n",
      "“ye-es,” said mrs. ackroyd. “oh! yes,” she added firmly.\n",
      "but i had noted the momentary hesitation, and i knew that there was\n",
      "still something she was keeping back. it was nothing less than a flash\n",
      "of sheer genius that prompted me to ask the question i did.\n",
      "“mrs. ackroyd,” i said, “was it you who left the silver table open?”\n",
      "i had my answer in the blush of guilt that even rouge and powder could\n",
      "not conceal.\n",
      "“how did you know?” she whispered.\n",
      "“it was you, then?”\n",
      "“yes—i—you see—there were one or two pieces of old silver—very\n",
      "interesting. i had been reading up the subject and there was an\n",
      "illustration of quite a small piece which had fetched an immense\n",
      "sum at christy’s. it looked to me just the same as the one in the\n",
      "silver table. i thought i would take it up to london with me when i\n",
      "went—and—and have it valued. then if it really was a valuable piece,\n",
      "just think what a charming surprise it would have been for roger?”\n",
      "i refrained from comments, accepting mrs. ackroyd’s story on its\n",
      "merits. i even forbore to ask her why it was necessary to abstract what\n",
      "she wanted in such a surreptitious manner.\n",
      "“why did you leave the lid open?” i asked. “did you forget?”\n",
      "“i was startled,” said mrs. ackroyd. “i heard footsteps coming along\n",
      "the terrace outside. i hastened out of the room and just got up the\n",
      "stairs before parker opened the front door to you.”\n",
      "“that must have been miss russell,” i said thoughtfully. mrs. ackroyd\n",
      "had revealed to me one fact that was extremely interesting. whether her\n",
      "designs upon ackroyd’s silver had been strictly honorable i neither\n",
      "knew nor cared. what did interest me was the fact that miss russell\n",
      "must have entered the drawing-room by the window, and that i had not\n",
      "been wrong when i judged her to be out of breath with running. where\n",
      "had she been? i thought of the summer-house and the scrap of cambric.\n",
      "“i wonder if miss russell has her handkerchiefs starched!” i exclaimed\n",
      "on the spur of the moment.\n",
      "mrs. ackroyd’s start recalled me to myself, and i rose.\n",
      "“you think you can explain to m. poirot?” she asked anxiously.\n",
      "“oh, certainly. absolutely.”\n",
      "i got away at last, after being forced to listen to more justifications\n",
      "of her conduct.\n",
      "the parlormaid was in the hall, and it was she who helped me on with my\n",
      "overcoat. i observed her more closely than i had done heretofore. it\n",
      "was clear that she had been crying.\n",
      "“how is it,” i asked, “that you told us that mr. ackroyd sent for you\n",
      "on friday to his study? i hear now that it was _you_ who asked to speak\n",
      "to _him_?”\n",
      "for a minute the girl’s eyes dropped before mine.\n",
      "then she spoke.\n",
      "“i meant to leave in any case,” she said uncertainly.\n",
      "i said no more. she opened the front door for me. just as i was passing\n",
      "out, she said suddenly in a low voice:—\n",
      "“excuse me, sir, is there any news of captain paton?”\n",
      "i shook my head, looking at her inquiringly.\n",
      "“he ought to come back,” she said. “indeed—indeed he ought to come\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "she was looking at me with appealing eyes.\n",
      "“does no one know where he is?” she asked.\n",
      "“do you?” i said sharply.\n",
      "she shook her head.\n",
      "“no, indeed. i know nothing. but any one who was a friend to him would\n",
      "tell him this: he ought to come back.”\n",
      "i lingered, thinking that perhaps the girl would say more. her next\n",
      "question surprised me.\n",
      "“when do they think the murder was done? just before ten o’clock?”\n",
      "“that is the idea,” i said. “between a quarter to ten and the hour.”\n",
      "“not earlier? not before a quarter to ten?”\n",
      "i looked at her attentively. she was so clearly eager for a reply in\n",
      "the affirmative.\n",
      "“that’s out of the question,” i said. “miss ackroyd saw her uncle alive\n",
      "at a quarter to ten.”\n",
      "she turned away, and her whole figure seemed to droop.\n",
      "“a handsome girl,” i said to myself as i drove off. “an exceedingly\n",
      "handsome girl.”\n",
      "caroline was at home. she had had a visit from poirot and was very\n",
      "pleased and important about it.\n",
      "“i am helping him with the case,” she explained.\n",
      "i felt rather uneasy. caroline is bad enough as it is. what will she be\n",
      "like with her detective instincts encouraged?\n",
      "“are you going round the neighborhood looking for ralph paton’s\n",
      "mysterious girl?” i inquired.\n",
      "“i might do that on my own account,” said caroline. “no, this is a\n",
      "special thing m. poirot wants me to find out for him.”\n",
      "“what is it?” i asked.\n",
      "“he wants to know whether ralph paton’s boots were black or brown,”\n",
      "said caroline with tremendous solemnity.\n",
      "i stared at her. i see now that i was unbelievably stupid about these\n",
      "boots. i failed altogether to grasp the point.\n",
      "“they were brown shoes,” i said. “i saw them.”\n",
      "“not shoes, james, boots. m. poirot wants to know whether a pair of\n",
      "boots ralph had with him at the hotel were brown or black. a lot hangs\n",
      "on it.”\n",
      "call me dense if you like. i didn’t see.\n",
      "“and how are you going to find out?” i asked.\n",
      "caroline said there would be no difficulty about that. our annie’s\n",
      "dearest friend was miss ganett’s maid, clara. and clara was walking\n",
      "out with the boots at the three boars. the whole thing was simplicity\n",
      "itself, and by the aid of miss ganett, who coöperated loyally, at once\n",
      "giving clara leave of absence, the matter was rushed through at express\n",
      "speed.\n",
      "it was when we were sitting down to lunch that caroline remarked, with\n",
      "would-be unconcern:—\n",
      "“about those boots of ralph paton’s.”\n",
      "“well,” i said, “what about them?”\n",
      "“m. poirot thought they were probably brown. he was wrong. they’re\n",
      "black.”\n",
      "and caroline nodded her head several times. she evidently felt that she\n",
      "had scored a point over poirot.\n",
      "i did not answer. i was puzzling over what the color of a pair of ralph\n",
      "paton’s boots had to do with the case.\n",
      " chapter xv\n",
      " geoffrey raymond\n",
      "i was to have a further proof that day of the success of poirot’s\n",
      "tactics. that challenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his\n",
      "knowledge of human nature. a mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the\n",
      "truth from mrs. ackroyd. she was the first to react.\n",
      "that afternoon when i returned from seeing my patients, caroline told\n",
      "me that geoffrey raymond had just left.\n",
      "“did he want to see me?” i asked, as i hung up my coat in the hall.\n",
      "caroline was hovering by my elbow.\n",
      "“it was m. poirot he wanted to see,” she said. “he’d just come from the\n",
      "larches. m. poirot was out. mr. raymond thought that he might be here,\n",
      "or that you might know where he was.”\n",
      "“i haven’t the least idea.”\n",
      "“i tried to make him wait,” said caroline, “but he said he would call\n",
      "back at the larches in half an hour, and went away down the village. a\n",
      "great pity, because m. poirot came in practically the minute after he\n",
      "left.”\n",
      "“came in here?”\n",
      "“no, to his own house.”\n",
      "“how do you know?”\n",
      "“the side window,” said caroline briefly.\n",
      "it seemed to me that we had now exhausted the topic. caroline thought\n",
      "otherwise.\n",
      "“aren’t you going across?”\n",
      "“across where?”\n",
      "“to the larches, of course.”\n",
      "“my dear caroline,” i said, “what for?”\n",
      "“mr. raymond wanted to see him very particularly,” said caroline. “you\n",
      "might hear what it’s all about.”\n",
      "i raised my eyebrows.\n",
      "“curiosity is not my besetting sin,” i remarked coldly. “i can exist\n",
      "comfortably without knowing exactly what my neighbors are doing and\n",
      "thinking.”\n",
      "“stuff and nonsense, james,” said my sister. “you want to know just\n",
      "as much as i do. you’re not so honest, that’s all. you always have to\n",
      "pretend.”\n",
      "“really, caroline,” i said, and retired into my surgery.\n",
      "ten minutes later caroline tapped at the door and entered. in her hand\n",
      "she held what seemed to be a pot of jam.\n",
      "“i wonder, james,” she said, “if you would mind taking this pot of\n",
      "medlar jelly across to m. poirot? i promised it to him. he has never\n",
      "tasted any home-made medlar jelly.”\n",
      "“why can’t annie go?” i asked coldly.\n",
      "“she’s doing some mending. i can’t spare her.”\n",
      "caroline and i looked at each other.\n",
      "“very well,” i said, rising. “but if i take the beastly thing, i shall\n",
      "just leave it at the door. you understand that?”\n",
      "my sister raised her eyebrows.\n",
      "“naturally,” she said. “who suggested you should do anything else?”\n",
      "the honors were with caroline.\n",
      "“if you _do_ happen to see m. poirot,” she said, as i opened the front\n",
      "door, “you might tell him about the boots.”\n",
      "it was a most subtle parting shot. i wanted dreadfully to understand\n",
      "the enigma of the boots. when the old lady with the breton cap opened\n",
      "the door to me, i found myself asking if m. poirot was in, quite\n",
      "automatically.\n",
      "poirot sprang up to meet me, with every appearance of pleasure.\n",
      "“sit down, my good friend,” he said. “the big chair? this small one?\n",
      "the room is not too hot, no?”\n",
      "i thought it was stifling, but refrained from saying so. the windows\n",
      "were closed, and a large fire burned in the grate.\n",
      "“the english people, they have a mania for the fresh air,” declared\n",
      "poirot. “the big air, it is all very well outside, where it belongs.\n",
      "why admit it to the house? but let us not discuss such banalities. you\n",
      "have something for me, yes?”\n",
      "“two things,” i said. “first—this—from my sister.”\n",
      "i handed over the pot of medlar jelly.\n",
      "“how kind of mademoiselle caroline. she has remembered her promise. and\n",
      "the second thing?”\n",
      "“information—of a kind.”\n",
      "and i told him of my interview with mrs. ackroyd. he listened with\n",
      "interest, but not much excitement.\n",
      "“it clears the ground,” he said thoughtfully. “and it has a certain\n",
      "value as confirming the evidence of the housekeeper. she said, you\n",
      "remember, that she found the silver table lid open and closed it down\n",
      "in passing.”\n",
      "“what about her statement that she went into the drawing-room to see if\n",
      "the flowers were fresh?”\n",
      "“ah! we never took that very seriously, did we, my friend? it was\n",
      "patently an excuse, trumped up in a hurry, by a woman who felt it\n",
      "urgent to explain her presence—which, by the way, you would probably\n",
      "never have thought of questioning. i considered it possible that her\n",
      "agitation might arise from the fact that she had been tampering with\n",
      "the silver table, but i think now that we must look for another cause.”\n",
      "“yes,” i said. “whom did she go out to meet? and why?”\n",
      "“you think she went to meet some one?”\n",
      "“i do.”\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“so do i,” he said thoughtfully.\n",
      "there was a pause.\n",
      "“by the way,” i said, “i’ve got a message for you from my sister. ralph\n",
      "paton’s boots were black, not brown.”\n",
      "i was watching him closely as i gave the message, and i fancied that\n",
      "i saw a momentary flicker of discomposure. if so, it passed almost\n",
      "immediately.\n",
      "“she is absolutely positive they are not brown?”\n",
      "“absolutely.”\n",
      "“ah!” said poirot regretfully. “that is a pity.”\n",
      "and he seemed quite crestfallen.\n",
      "he entered into no explanations, but at once started a new subject of\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "“the housekeeper, miss russell, who came to consult you on that friday\n",
      "morning—is it indiscreet to ask what passed at the interview—apart from\n",
      "the medical details, i mean?”\n",
      "“not at all,” i said. “when the professional part of the conversation\n",
      "was over, we talked for a few minutes about poisons, and the ease or\n",
      "difficulty of detecting them, and about drug-taking and drug-takers.”\n",
      "“with special reference to cocaine?” asked poirot.\n",
      "“how did you know?” i asked, somewhat surprised.\n",
      "for answer, the little man rose and crossed the room to where\n",
      "newspapers were filed. he brought me a copy of the _daily budget_,\n",
      "dated friday, 16th september, and showed me an article dealing with the\n",
      "smuggling of cocaine. it was a somewhat lurid article, written with an\n",
      "eye to picturesque effect.\n",
      "“that is what put cocaine into her head, my friend,” he said.\n",
      "i would have catechized him further, for i did not quite understand his\n",
      "meaning, but at that moment the door opened and geoffrey raymond was\n",
      "announced.\n",
      "he came in fresh and debonair as ever, and greeted us both.\n",
      "“how are you, doctor? m. poirot, this is the second time i’ve been here\n",
      "this morning. i was anxious to catch you.”\n",
      "“perhaps i’d better be off,” i suggested rather awkwardly.\n",
      "“not on my account, doctor. no, it’s just this,” he went on, seating\n",
      "himself at a wave of invitation from poirot, “i’ve got a confession to\n",
      "make.”\n",
      "“_en verité_?” said poirot, with an air of polite interest.\n",
      "“oh, it’s of no consequence, really. but, as a matter of fact, my\n",
      "conscience has been pricking me ever since yesterday afternoon. you\n",
      "accused us all of keeping back something, m. poirot. i plead guilty.\n",
      "i’ve had something up my sleeve.”\n",
      "“and what is that, m. raymond?”\n",
      "“as i say, it’s nothing of consequence—just this. i was in debt—badly,\n",
      "and that legacy came in the nick of time. five hundred pounds puts me\n",
      "on my feet again with a little to spare.”\n",
      "he smiled at us both with that engaging frankness that made him such a\n",
      "likable youngster.\n",
      "“you know how it is. suspicious looking policeman—don’t like to admit\n",
      "you were hard up for money—think it will look bad to them. but i was\n",
      "a fool, really, because blunt and i were in the billiard room from a\n",
      "quarter to ten onwards, so i’ve got a watertight alibi and nothing to\n",
      "fear. still, when you thundered out that stuff about concealing things,\n",
      "i felt a nasty prick of conscience, and i thought i’d like to get it\n",
      "off my mind.”\n",
      "he got up again and stood smiling at us.\n",
      "“you are a very wise young man,” said poirot, nodding at him with\n",
      "approval. “see you, when i know that any one is hiding things from me,\n",
      "i suspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed. you\n",
      "have done well.”\n",
      "“i’m glad i’m cleared from suspicion,” laughed raymond. “i’ll be off\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "“so that is that,” i remarked, as the door closed behind the young\n",
      "secretary.\n",
      "“yes,” agreed poirot. “a mere bagatelle—but if he had not been in the\n",
      "billiard room—who knows? after all, many crimes have been committed for\n",
      "the sake of less than five hundred pounds. it all depends on what sum\n",
      "is sufficient to break a man. a question of the relativity, is it not\n",
      "so? have you reflected, my friend, that many people in that house stood\n",
      "to benefit by mr. ackroyd’s death? mrs. ackroyd, miss flora, young mr.\n",
      "raymond, the housekeeper, miss russell. only one, in fact, does not,\n",
      "major blunt.”\n",
      "his tone in uttering that name was so peculiar that i looked up,\n",
      "puzzled.\n",
      "“i don’t quite understand you?” i said.\n",
      "“two of the people i accused have given me the truth.”\n",
      "“you think major blunt has something to conceal also?”\n",
      "“as for that,” remarked poirot nonchalantly, “there is a saying, is\n",
      "there not, that englishmen conceal only one thing—their love? and major\n",
      "blunt, i should say, is not good at concealments.”\n",
      "“sometimes,” i said, “i wonder if we haven’t rather jumped to\n",
      "conclusions on one point.”\n",
      "“what is that?”\n",
      "“we’ve assumed that the blackmailer of mrs. ferrars is necessarily the\n",
      "murderer of mr. ackroyd. mightn’t we be mistaken?”\n",
      "poirot nodded energetically.\n",
      "“very good. very good indeed. i wondered if that idea would come to\n",
      "you. of course it is possible. but we must remember one point. the\n",
      "letter disappeared. still, that, as you say, may not necessarily mean\n",
      "that the murderer took it. when you first found the body, parker may\n",
      "have abstracted the letter unnoticed by you.”\n",
      "“parker?”\n",
      "“yes, parker. i always come back to parker—not as the murderer—no, he\n",
      "did not commit the murder; but who is more suitable than he as the\n",
      "mysterious scoundrel who terrorized mrs. ferrars? he may have got his\n",
      "information about mr. ferrars’s death from one of the king’s paddock\n",
      "servants. at any rate, he is more likely to have come upon it than a\n",
      "casual guest such as blunt, for instance.”\n",
      "“parker might have taken the letter,” i admitted. “it wasn’t till later\n",
      "that i noticed it was gone.”\n",
      "“how much later? after blunt and raymond were in the room, or before?”\n",
      "“i can’t remember,” i said slowly. “i think it was before—no,\n",
      "afterwards. yes, i’m almost sure it was afterwards.”\n",
      "“that widens the field to three,” said poirot thoughtfully. “but parker\n",
      "is the most likely. it is in my mind to try a little experiment with\n",
      "parker. how say you, my friend, will you accompany me to fernly?”\n",
      "i acquiesced, and we set out at once. poirot asked to see miss ackroyd,\n",
      "and presently flora came to us.\n",
      "“mademoiselle flora,” said poirot, “i have to confide in you a little\n",
      "secret. i am not yet satisfied of the innocence of parker. i propose to\n",
      "make a little experiment with your assistance. i want to reconstruct\n",
      "some of his actions on that night. but we must think of something to\n",
      "tell him—ah! i have it. i wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices\n",
      "in the little lobby could have been heard outside on the terrace. now,\n",
      "ring for parker, if you will be so good.”\n",
      "i did so, and presently the butler appeared, suave as ever.\n",
      "“you rang, sir?”\n",
      "“yes, my good parker. i have in mind a little experiment. i have placed\n",
      "major blunt on the terrace outside the study window. i want to see if\n",
      "any one there could have heard the voices of miss ackroyd and yourself\n",
      "in the lobby that night. i want to enact that little scene over again.\n",
      "perhaps you would fetch the tray or whatever it was you were carrying?”\n",
      "parker vanished, and we repaired to the lobby outside the study door.\n",
      "presently we heard a chink in the outer hall, and parker appeared in\n",
      "the doorway carrying a tray with a siphon, a decanter of whisky, and\n",
      "two glasses on it.\n",
      "“one moment,” cried poirot, raising his hand and seemingly very\n",
      "excited. “we must have everything in order. just as it occurred. it is\n",
      "a little method of mine.”\n",
      "“a foreign custom, sir,” said parker. “reconstruction of the crime they\n",
      "call it, do they not?”\n",
      "he was quite imperturbable as he stood there politely waiting on\n",
      "poirot’s orders.\n",
      "“ah! he knows something, the good parker,” cried poirot. “he has read\n",
      "of these things. now, i beg you, let us have everything of the most\n",
      "exact. you came from the outer hall—so. mademoiselle was—where?”\n",
      "“here,” said flora, taking up her stand just outside the study door.\n",
      "“quite right, sir,” said parker.\n",
      "“i had just closed the door,” continued flora.\n",
      "“yes, miss,” agreed parker. “your hand was still on the handle as it is\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "“then _allez_,” said poirot. “play me the little comedy.”\n",
      "flora stood with her hand on the door handle, and parker came stepping\n",
      "through the door from the hall, bearing the tray.\n",
      "he stopped just inside the door. flora spoke.\n",
      "“oh! parker. mr. ackroyd doesn’t want to be disturbed again to-night.”\n",
      "“is that right?” she added in an undertone.\n",
      "“to the best of my recollection, miss flora,” said parker, “but i fancy\n",
      "you used the word evening instead of night.” then, raising his voice\n",
      "in a somewhat theatrical fashion: “very good, miss. shall i lock up as\n",
      "usual?”\n",
      "“yes, please.”\n",
      "parker retired through the door, flora followed him, and started to\n",
      "ascend the main staircase.\n",
      "“is that enough?” she asked over her shoulder.\n",
      "“admirable,” declared the little man, rubbing his hands. “by the way,\n",
      "parker, are you sure there were two glasses on the tray that evening?\n",
      "who was the second one for?”\n",
      "“i always bring two glasses, sir,” said parker. “is there anything\n",
      "further?”\n",
      "“nothing. i thank you.”\n",
      "parker withdrew, dignified to the last.\n",
      "poirot stood in the middle of the hall frowning. flora came down and\n",
      "joined us.\n",
      "“has your experiment been successful?” she asked. “i don’t quite\n",
      "understand, you know——”\n",
      "poirot smiled admiringly at her.\n",
      "“it is not necessary that you should,” he said. “but tell me, were\n",
      "there indeed two glasses on parker’s tray that night?”\n",
      "flora wrinkled her brows a minute.\n",
      "“i really can’t remember,” she said. “i think there were. is—is that\n",
      "the object of your experiment?”\n",
      "poirot took her hand and patted it.\n",
      "“put it this way,” he said. “i am always interested to see if people\n",
      "will speak the truth.”\n",
      "“and did parker speak the truth?”\n",
      "“i rather think he did,” said poirot thoughtfully.\n",
      "a few minutes later saw us retracing our steps to the village.\n",
      "“what was the point of that question about the glasses?” i asked\n",
      "curiously.\n",
      "poirot shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "“one must say something,” he remarked. “that particular question did as\n",
      "well as any other.”\n",
      "i stared at him.\n",
      "“at any rate, my friend,” he said more seriously, “i know now something\n",
      "i wanted to know. let us leave it at that.”\n",
      " chapter xvi\n",
      " an evening at mah jong\n",
      "that night we had a little mah jong party. this kind of simple\n",
      "entertainment is very popular in king’s abbot. the guests arrive in\n",
      "goloshes and waterproofs after dinner. they partake of coffee and later\n",
      "of cake, sandwiches, and tea.\n",
      "on this particular night our guests were miss ganett and colonel\n",
      "carter, who lives near the church. a good deal of gossip is handed\n",
      "round at these evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the\n",
      "game in progress. we used to play bridge—chatty bridge of the worst\n",
      "description. we find mah jong much more peaceful. the irritated demand\n",
      "as to why on earth your partner did not lead a certain card is entirely\n",
      "done away with, and though we still express criticisms frankly, there\n",
      "is not the same acrimonious spirit.\n",
      "“very cold evening, eh, sheppard?” said colonel carter, standing with\n",
      "his back to the fire. caroline had taken miss ganett to her own room,\n",
      "and was there assisting her to disentangle herself from her many wraps.\n",
      "“reminds me of the afghan passes.”\n",
      "“indeed?” i said politely.\n",
      "“very mysterious business this about poor ackroyd,” continued the\n",
      "colonel, accepting a cup of coffee. “a deuce of a lot behind it—that’s\n",
      "what i say. between you and me, sheppard, i’ve heard the word blackmail\n",
      "mentioned!”\n",
      "the colonel gave me the look which might be tabulated “one man of the\n",
      "world to another.”\n",
      "“a woman in it, no doubt,” he said. “depend upon it, a woman in it.”\n",
      "caroline and miss ganett joined us at this minute. miss ganett drank\n",
      "coffee whilst caroline got out the mah jong box and poured out the\n",
      "tiles upon the table.\n",
      "“washing the tiles,” said the colonel facetiously. “that’s\n",
      "right—washing the tiles, as we used to say in the shanghai club.”\n",
      "it is the private opinion of both caroline and myself that colonel\n",
      "carter has never been in the shanghai club in his life. more, that he\n",
      "has never been farther east than india, where he juggled with tins of\n",
      "bully beef and plum and apple jam during the great war. but the colonel\n",
      "is determinedly military, and in king’s abbot we permit people to\n",
      "indulge their little idiosyncrasies freely.\n",
      "“shall we begin?” said caroline.\n",
      "we sat round the table. for some five minutes there was complete\n",
      "silence, owing to the fact that there is tremendous secret competition\n",
      "amongst us as to who can build their wall quickest.\n",
      "“go on, james,” said caroline at last. “you’re east wind.”\n",
      "i discarded a tile. a round or two proceeded, broken by the monotonous\n",
      "remarks of “three bamboos,” “two circles,” “pung,” and frequently\n",
      "from miss ganett “unpung,” owing to that lady’s habit of too hastily\n",
      "claiming tiles to which she had no right.\n",
      "“i saw flora ackroyd this morning,” said miss ganett. “pung—no—unpung.\n",
      "i made a mistake.”\n",
      "“four circles,” said caroline. “where did you see her?”\n",
      "“she didn’t see _me_,” said miss ganett, with that tremendous\n",
      "significance only to be met with in small villages.\n",
      "“ah!” said caroline interestedly. “chow.”\n",
      "“i believe,” said miss ganett, temporarily diverted, “that it’s the\n",
      "right thing nowadays to say ‘chee’ not ‘chow.’”\n",
      "“nonsense,” said caroline. “i have always said ‘_chow_.’”\n",
      "“in the shanghai club,” said colonel carter, “they say ‘_chow_.’”\n",
      "miss ganett retired, crushed.\n",
      "“what were you saying about flora ackroyd?” asked caroline, after a\n",
      "moment or two devoted to the game. “was she with any one?”\n",
      "“very much so,” said miss ganett.\n",
      "the eyes of the two ladies met, and seemed to exchange information.\n",
      "“really,” said caroline interestedly. “is that it? well, it doesn’t\n",
      "surprise me in the least.”\n",
      "“we’re waiting for you to discard, miss caroline,” said the colonel. he\n",
      "sometimes affects the pose of the bluff male, intent on the game and\n",
      "indifferent to gossip. but nobody is deceived.\n",
      "“if you ask me,” said miss ganett. (“was that a bamboo you discarded,\n",
      "dear? oh! no, i see now—it was a circle.) as i was saying, if you ask\n",
      "me, flora’s been exceedingly lucky. exceedingly lucky she’s been.”\n",
      "“how’s that, miss ganett?” asked the colonel. “i’ll pung that green\n",
      "dragon. how do you make out that miss flora’s been lucky? very charming\n",
      "girl and all that, i know.”\n",
      "“i mayn’t know very much about crime,” said miss ganett, with the air\n",
      "of one who knows everything there is to know, “but i can tell you one\n",
      "thing. the first question that’s always asked is ‘who last saw the\n",
      "deceased alive?’ and the person who did is regarded with suspicion.\n",
      "now, flora ackroyd last saw her uncle alive. it might have looked very\n",
      "nasty for her—very nasty indeed. it’s my opinion—and i give it for what\n",
      "it’s worth, that ralph paton is staying away on her account, to draw\n",
      "suspicion away from her.”\n",
      "“come, now,” i protested mildly, “you surely can’t suggest that a young\n",
      "girl like flora ackroyd is capable of stabbing her uncle in cold blood?”\n",
      "“well, i don’t know,” said miss ganett. “i’ve just been reading a book\n",
      "from the library about the underworld of paris, and it says that some\n",
      "of the worst women criminals are young girls with the faces of angels.”\n",
      "“that’s in france,” said caroline instantly.\n",
      "“just so,” said the colonel. “now, i’ll tell you a very curious thing—a\n",
      "story that was going round the bazaars in india....”\n",
      "the colonel’s story was one of interminable length, and of curiously\n",
      "little interest. a thing that happened in india many years ago cannot\n",
      "compare for a moment with an event that took place in king’s abbot the\n",
      "day before yesterday.\n",
      "it was caroline who brought the colonel’s story to a close by\n",
      "fortunately going mah jong. after the slight unpleasantness always\n",
      "occasioned by my corrections of caroline’s somewhat faulty arithmetic,\n",
      "we started a new hand.\n",
      "“east wind passes,” said caroline. “i’ve got an idea of my own about\n",
      "ralph paton. three characters. but i’m keeping it to myself for the\n",
      "present.”\n",
      "“are you, dear?” said miss ganett. “chow—i mean pung.”\n",
      "“yes,” said caroline firmly.\n",
      "“was it all right about the boots?” asked miss ganett. “their being\n",
      "black, i mean?”\n",
      "“quite all right,” said caroline.\n",
      "“what was the point, do you think?” asked miss ganett.\n",
      "caroline pursed up her lips, and shook her head with an air of knowing\n",
      "all about it.\n",
      "“pung,” said miss ganett. “no—unpung. i suppose that now the doctor’s\n",
      "in with m. poirot he knows all the secrets?”\n",
      "“far from it,” i said.\n",
      "“james is so modest,” said caroline. “ah! a concealed kong.”\n",
      "the colonel gave vent to a whistle. for the moment gossip was\n",
      "forgotten.\n",
      "“your own wind, too,” he said. “_and_ you’ve got two pungs of dragons.\n",
      "we must be careful. miss caroline’s out for a big hand.”\n",
      "we played for some minutes with no irrelevant conversation.\n",
      "“this m. poirot now,” said colonel carter, “is he really such a great\n",
      "detective?”\n",
      "“the greatest the world has ever known,” said caroline solemnly. “he\n",
      "had to come here incognito to avoid publicity.”\n",
      "“chow,” said miss ganett. “quite wonderful for our little village, i’m\n",
      "sure. by the way, clara—my maid, you know—is great friends with elsie,\n",
      "the housemaid at fernly, and what do you think elsie told her? that\n",
      "there’s been a lot of money stolen, and it’s her opinion—elsie’s—i\n",
      "mean, that the parlormaid had something to do with it. she’s leaving\n",
      "at the month, and she’s crying a good deal at night. if you ask me,\n",
      "the girl is very likely in league with a _gang_. she’s always been a\n",
      "queer girl—she’s not friends with any of the girls round here. she\n",
      "goes off by herself on her days out—very unnatural, i call it, and\n",
      "most suspicious. i asked her once to come to our girls’ friendly\n",
      "evenings, but she refused, and then i asked her a few questions about\n",
      "her home and her family—all that sort of thing, and i’m bound to say i\n",
      "considered her manner most impertinent. outwardly very respectful—but\n",
      "she shut me up in the most barefaced way.”\n",
      "miss ganett stopped for breath, and the colonel, who was totally\n",
      "uninterested in the servant question, remarked that in the shanghai\n",
      "club brisk play was the invariable rule.\n",
      "we had a round of brisk play.\n",
      "“that miss russell,” said caroline. “she came here pretending to\n",
      "consult james on friday morning. it’s my opinion she wanted to see\n",
      "where the poisons were kept. five characters.”\n",
      "“chow,” said miss ganett. “what an extraordinary idea? i wonder if you\n",
      "can be right.”\n",
      "“talking of poisons,” said the colonel. “eh—what? haven’t i discarded?\n",
      "oh! eight bamboos.”\n",
      "“mah jong!” said miss ganett.\n",
      "caroline was very much annoyed.\n",
      "“one red dragon,” she said regretfully, “and i should have had a hand\n",
      "of three doubles.”\n",
      "“i’ve had two red dragons all the time,” i mentioned.\n",
      "“so exactly like you, james,” said caroline reproachfully. “you’ve no\n",
      "conception of the spirit of the game.”\n",
      "i myself thought i had played rather cleverly. i should have had to pay\n",
      "caroline an enormous amount if she had gone mah jong. miss ganett’s mah\n",
      "jong was of the poorest variety possible, as caroline did not fail to\n",
      "point out to her.\n",
      "east wind passed, and we started a new hand in silence.\n",
      "“what i was going to tell you just now was this,” said caroline.\n",
      "“yes?” said miss ganett encouragingly.\n",
      "“my idea about ralph paton, i mean.”\n",
      "“yes, dear,” said miss ganett, still more encouragingly. “chow!”\n",
      "“it’s a sign of weakness to chow so early,” said caroline severely.\n",
      "“you should go for a big hand.”\n",
      "“i know,” said miss ganett. “you were saying—about ralph paton, you\n",
      "know?”\n",
      "“yes. well, i’ve a pretty shrewd idea where he is.”\n",
      "we all stopped to stare at her.\n",
      "“this is very interesting, miss caroline,” said colonel carter. “all\n",
      "your own idea, eh?”\n",
      "“well, not exactly. i’ll tell you about it. you know that big map of\n",
      "the county we have in the hall?”\n",
      "we all said yes.\n",
      "“as m. poirot was going out the other day, he stopped and looked at it,\n",
      "and he made some remark—i can’t remember exactly what it was. something\n",
      "about cranchester being the only big town anywhere near us—which is\n",
      "true, of course. but after he had gone—it came to me suddenly.”\n",
      "“what came to you?”\n",
      "“his meaning. of course ralph is in cranchester.”\n",
      "it was at that moment that i knocked down the rack that held my pieces.\n",
      "my sister immediately reproved me for clumsiness, but half-heartedly.\n",
      "she was intent on her theory.\n",
      "“cranchester, miss caroline?” said colonel carter. “surely not\n",
      "cranchester! it’s so near.”\n",
      "“that’s exactly it,” cried caroline triumphantly. “it seems quite clear\n",
      "by now that he didn’t get away from here by train. he must simply have\n",
      "walked into cranchester. and i believe he’s there still. no one would\n",
      "dream of his being so near at hand.”\n",
      "i pointed out several objections to the theory, but when once caroline\n",
      "has got something firmly into her head, nothing dislodges it.\n",
      "“and you think m. poirot has the same idea,” said miss ganett\n",
      "thoughtfully. “it’s a curious coincidence, but i was out for a walk\n",
      "this afternoon on the cranchester road, and he passed me in a car\n",
      "coming from that direction.”\n",
      "we all looked at each other.\n",
      "“why, dear me,” said miss ganett suddenly, “i’m mah jong all the time,\n",
      "and i never noticed it.”\n",
      "caroline’s attention was distracted from her own inventive exercises.\n",
      "she pointed out to miss ganett that a hand consisting of mixed suits\n",
      "and too many chows was hardly worth going mah jong on. miss ganett\n",
      "listened imperturbably and collected her counters.\n",
      "“yes, dear, i know what you mean,” she said. “but it rather depends on\n",
      "what kind of a hand you have to start with, doesn’t it?”\n",
      "“you’ll never get the big hands if you don’t go for them,” urged\n",
      "caroline.\n",
      "“well, we must all play our own way, mustn’t we?” said miss ganett. she\n",
      "looked down at her counters. “after all, i’m up, so far.”\n",
      "caroline, who was considerably down, said nothing.\n",
      "east wind passed, and we set to once more. annie brought in the tea\n",
      "things. caroline and miss ganett were both slightly ruffled as is\n",
      "often the case during one of these festive evenings.\n",
      "“if you would only play a leetle quicker, dear,” said caroline, as miss\n",
      "ganett hesitated over her discard. “the chinese put down the tiles so\n",
      "quickly it sounds like little birds pattering.”\n",
      "for some few minutes we played like the chinese.\n",

      "“wise man,” said the colonel with a chuckle. “he doesn’t give himself\n",
      "away. but they’re wonderful fellows, these foreign detectives. up to\n",
      "all sorts of dodges, i believe.”\n",
      "“pung,” said miss ganett, in a tone of quiet triumph. “and mah jong.”\n",
      "the situation became more strained. it was annoyance at miss ganett’s\n",
      "going mah jong for the third time running which prompted caroline to\n",
      "say to me as we built a fresh wall:—\n",
      "“you are too tiresome, james. you sit there like a dead head, and say\n",
      "nothing at all!”\n",
      "“but, my dear,” i protested, “i have really nothing to say—that is, of\n",
      "the kind you mean.”\n",
      "“nonsense,” said caroline, as she sorted her hand. “you _must_ know\n",
      "something interesting.”\n",
      "i did not answer for a moment. i was overwhelmed and intoxicated. i had\n",
      "read of there being such a thing as the perfect winning—going mah jong\n",
      "on one’s original hand. i had never hoped to hold the hand myself.\n",
      "with suppressed triumph i laid my hand face upwards on the table.\n",
      "“as they say in the shanghai club,” i remarked, “tin-ho—the perfect\n",
      "winning!”\n",
      "the colonel’s eyes nearly bulged out of his head.\n",
      "“upon my soul,” he said. “what an extraordinary thing. i never saw that\n",
      "happen before!”\n",
      "it was then that i went on, goaded by caroline’s gibes, and rendered\n",
      "reckless by my triumph.\n",
      "“and as to anything interesting,” i said. “what about a gold wedding\n",
      "ring with a date and ‘from r.’ inside.”\n",
      "i pass over the scene that followed. i was made to say exactly where\n",
      "this treasure was found. i was made to reveal the date.\n",
      "“march 13th,” said caroline. “just six months ago. ah!”\n",
      "out of the babel of excited suggestions and suppositions three theories\n",
      "were evolved:—\n",
      "1. that of colonel carter: that ralph was secretly married to flora.\n",
      "the first or most simple solution.\n",
      "2. that of miss ganett: that roger ackroyd had been secretly married to\n",
      "mrs. ferrars.\n",
      "3. that of my sister: that roger ackroyd had married his housekeeper,\n",
      "miss russell.\n",
      "a fourth or super-theory was propounded by caroline later as we went up\n",
      "to bed.\n",
      "“mark my words,” she said suddenly, “i shouldn’t be at all surprised if\n",
      "geoffrey raymond and flora weren’t married.”\n",
      "“surely it would be ‘from g,’ not ‘from r’ then,” i suggested.\n",
      "“you never know. some girls call men by their surnames. and you heard\n",
      "what miss ganett said this evening—about flora’s carryings on.”\n",
      "strictly speaking, i had not heard miss ganett say anything of the\n",
      "kind, but i respected caroline’s knowledge of innuendoes.\n",
      "“how about hector blunt,” i hinted. “if it’s anybody——”\n",
      "“nonsense,” said caroline. “i dare say he admires her—may even be in\n",
      "love with her. but depend upon it a girl isn’t going to fall in love\n",
      "with a man old enough to be her father when there’s a good-looking\n",
      "young secretary about. she may encourage major blunt just as a blind.\n",
      "girls are very artful. but there’s one thing i _do_ tell you, james\n",

      "it occurred to me the next morning that under the exhilaration\n",
      "produced by tin-ho, or the perfect winning, i might have been slightly\n",
      "indiscreet. true, poirot had not asked me to keep the discovery of\n",
      "the ring to myself. on the other hand, he had said nothing about it\n",
      "whilst at fernly, and as far as i knew, i was the only person aware\n",
      "that it had been found. i felt distinctly guilty. the fact was by now\n",
      "spreading through king’s abbot like wildfire. i was expecting wholesale\n",
      "reproaches from poirot any minute.\n",
      "the joint funeral of mrs. ferrars and roger ackroyd was fixed for\n",
      "eleven o’clock. it was a melancholy and impressive ceremony. all the\n",

      "after it was over, poirot, who had also been present, took me by the\n",
      "arm, and invited me to accompany him back to the larches. he was\n",
      "looking very grave, and i feared that my indiscretion of the night\n",
      "before had got round to his ears. but it soon transpired that his\n",
      "thoughts were occupied by something of a totally different nature.\n",
      "“see you,” he said. “we must act. with your help i propose to examine a\n",
      "witness. we will question him, we will put such fear into him that the\n",
      "truth is bound to come out.”\n",
      "“what witness are you talking of?” i asked, very much surprised.\n",
      "“parker!” said poirot. “i asked him to be at my house this morning at\n",
      "twelve o’clock. he should await us there at this very minute.”\n",
      "“what do you think,” i ventured, glancing sideways at his face.\n",
      "“i know this—that i am not satisfied.”\n",
      "“you think that it was he who blackmailed mrs. ferrars?”\n",
      "“either that, or——”\n",
      "“well?” i said, after waiting a minute or two.\n",
      "“my friend, i will say this to you—i hope it was he.”\n",
      "the gravity of his manner, and something indefinable that tinged it,\n",
      "reduced me to silence.\n",
      "on arrival at the larches, we were informed that parker was already\n",
      "there awaiting our return. as we entered the room, the butler rose\n",
      "respectfully.\n",
      "“good morning, parker,” said poirot pleasantly. “one instant, i pray of\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "he removed his overcoat and gloves.\n",
      "“allow me, sir,” said parker, and sprang forward to assist him. he\n",
      "deposited the articles neatly on a chair by the door. poirot watched\n",
      "him with approval.\n",
      "“thank you, my good parker,” he said. “take a seat, will you not? what\n",
      "i have to say may take some time.”\n",
      "parker seated himself with an apologetic bend of the head.\n",
      "“now what do you think i asked you to come here for this morning—eh?”\n",
      "parker coughed.\n",
      "“i understood, sir, that you wished to ask me a few questions about my\n",
      "late master—private like.”\n",
      "“_précisément_,” said poirot, beaming. “have you made many experiments\n",
      "in blackmail?”\n",
      "“sir!”\n",
      "the butler sprang to his feet.\n",
      "“do not excite yourself,” said poirot placidly. “do not play the farce\n",

      "blackmail, is it not so?”\n",
      "“sir, i—i’ve never—never been——”\n",
      "“insulted,” suggested poirot, “in such a way before. then why, my\n",
      "excellent parker, were you so anxious to overhear the conversation in\n",
      "mr. ackroyd’s study the other evening, after you had caught the word\n",
      "blackmail?”\n",
      "“i wasn’t—i——”\n",
      "“who was your last master?” rapped out poirot suddenly.\n",
      "“my last master?”\n",
      "“yes, the master you were with before you came to mr. ackroyd.”\n",
      "“a major ellerby, sir——”\n",
      "poirot took the words out of his mouth.\n",
      "“just so, major ellerby. major ellerby was addicted to drugs, was he\n",
      "not? you traveled about with him. when he was in bermuda there was some\n",
      "trouble—a man was killed. major ellerby was partly responsible. it was\n",
      "hushed up. but you knew about it. how much did major ellerby pay you to\n",
      "keep your mouth shut?”\n",
      "parker was staring at him open-mouthed. the man had gone to pieces, his\n",
      "cheeks shook flabbily.\n",
      "“you see, me, i have made inquiries,” said poirot pleasantly. “it is\n",
      "as i say. you got a good sum then as blackmail, and major ellerby went\n",
      "on paying you until he died. now i want to hear about your latest\n",
      "experiment.”\n",
      "parker still stared.\n",
      "“it is useless to deny. hercule poirot _knows_. it is so, what i have\n",
      "said about major ellerby, is it not?”\n",
      "as though against his will, parker nodded reluctantly once. his face\n",
      "was ashen pale.\n",
      "“but i never hurt a hair of mr. ackroyd’s head,” he moaned. “honest to\n",
      "god, sir, i didn’t. i’ve been afraid of this coming all the time. and i\n",
      "tell you i didn’t—i didn’t kill him.”\n",
      "his voice rose almost to a scream.\n",
      "“i am inclined to believe you, my friend,” said poirot. “you have not\n",
      "the nerve—the courage. but i must have the truth.”\n",
      "“i’ll tell you anything, sir, anything you want to know. it’s true that\n",
      "i tried to listen that night. a word or two i heard made me curious.\n",
      "and mr. ackroyd’s wanting not to be disturbed, and shutting himself up\n",
      "with the doctor the way he did. it’s god’s own truth what i told the\n",
      "police. i heard the word blackmail, sir, and well——”\n",
      "he paused.\n",
      "“you thought there might be something in it for you?” suggested poirot\n",
      "smoothly.\n",
      "“well—well, yes, i did, sir. i thought that if mr. ackroyd was being\n",
      "blackmailed, why shouldn’t i have a share of the pickings?”\n",
      "a very curious expression passed over poirot’s face. he leaned forward.\n",
      "“had you any reason to suppose before that night that mr. ackroyd was\n",
      "being blackmailed?”\n",
      "“no, indeed, sir. it was a great surprise to me. such a regular\n",
      "gentleman in all his habits.”\n",
      "“how much did you overhear?”\n",
      "“not very much, sir. there seemed what i might call a spite against me.\n",
      "of course i had to attend to my duties in the pantry. and when i did\n",
      "creep along once or twice to the study it was no use. the first time\n",
      "dr. sheppard came out and almost caught me in the act, and another time\n",
      "mr. raymond passed me in the big hall and went that way, so i knew it\n",
      "was no use; and when i went with the tray, miss flora headed me off.”\n",
      "poirot stared for a long time at the man, as if to test his sincerity.\n",
      "parker returned his gaze earnestly.\n",
      "“i hope you believe me, sir. i’ve been afraid all along the police\n",
      "would rake up that old business with major ellerby and be suspicious of\n",
      "me in consequence.”\n",
      "“_eh bien_,” said poirot at last. “i am disposed to believe you. but\n",
      "there is one thing i must request of you—to show me your bank-book. you\n",
      "have a bank-book, i presume?”\n",
      "“yes, sir, as a matter of fact, i have it with me now.”\n",
      "with no sign of confusion, he produced it from his pocket. poirot took\n",
      "the slim, green-covered book and perused the entries.\n",
      "“ah! i perceive you have purchased £500 of national savings\n",
      "certificates this year?”\n",
      "“yes, sir. i have already over a thousand pounds saved—the result of\n",
      "my connection with—er—my late master, major ellerby. and i have had\n",
      "quite a little flutter on some horses this year—very successful. if you\n",
      "remember, sir, a rank outsider won the jubilee. i was fortunate enough\n",
      "to back it—£20.”\n",
      "poirot handed him back the book.\n",
      "“i will wish you good-morning. i believe that you have told me the\n",
      "truth. if you have not—so much the worse for you, my friend.”\n",
      "when parker had departed, poirot picked up his overcoat once more.\n",
      "“going out again?” i asked.\n",
      "“yes, we will pay a little visit to the good m. hammond.”\n",
      "“you believe parker’s story?”\n",
      "“it is credible enough on the face of it. it seems clear that—unless\n",
      "he is a very good actor indeed—he genuinely believes it was ackroyd\n",
      "himself who was the victim of blackmail. if so, he knows nothing at all\n",
      "about the mrs. ferrars business.”\n",
      "“then in that case—who——”\n",
      "“_précisément!_ who? but our visit to m. hammond will accomplish one\n",
      "purpose. it will either clear parker completely or else——”\n",
      "“well?”\n",
      "“i fall into the bad habit of leaving my sentences unfinished this\n",
      "morning,” said poirot apologetically. “you must bear with me.”\n",
      "“by the way,” i said, rather sheepishly, “i’ve got a confession to\n",
      "make. i’m afraid i have inadvertently let out something about that\n",
      "ring.”\n",
      "“what ring?”\n",
      "“the ring you found in the goldfish pond.”\n",
      "“ah! yes,” said poirot, smiling broadly.\n",
      "“i hope you’re not annoyed? it was very careless of me.”\n",
      "“but not at all, my good friend, not at all. i laid no commands upon\n",
      "you. you were at liberty to speak of it if you so wished. she was\n",
      "interested, your sister?”\n",
      "“she was indeed. it created a sensation. all sorts of theories are\n",
      "flying about.”\n",
      "“ah! and yet it is so simple. the true explanation leapt to the eye,\n",
      "did it not?”\n",
      "“did it?” i said dryly.\n",
      "poirot laughed.\n",
      "“the wise man does not commit himself,” he observed. “is not that so?\n",
      "but here we are at mr. hammond’s.”\n",
      "the lawyer was in his office, and we were ushered in without any delay.\n",
      "he rose and greeted us in his dry, precise manner.\n",
      "poirot came at once to the point.\n",
      "“monsieur, i desire from you certain information, that is, if you will\n",
      "be so good as to give it to me. you acted, i understand, for the late\n",
      "mrs. ferrars of king’s paddock?”\n",
      "i noticed the swift gleam of surprise which showed in the lawyer’s\n",
      "eyes, before his professional reserve came down once more like a mask\n",
      "over his face.\n",
      "“certainly. all her affairs passed through our hands.”\n",
      "“very good. now, before i ask you to tell me anything, i should like\n",
      "you to listen to the story dr. sheppard will relate to you. you have no\n",
      "objection, have you, my friend, to repeating the conversation you had\n",
      "with mr. ackroyd last friday night?”\n",
      "“not in the least,” i said, and straightway began the recital of that\n",
      "strange evening.\n",
      "hammond listened with close attention.\n",
      "“that is all,” i said, when i had finished.\n",
      "“blackmail,” said the lawyer thoughtfully.\n",
      "“you are surprised?” asked poirot.\n",
      "the lawyer took off his pince-nez and polished them with his\n",
      "handkerchief.\n",
      "“no,” he replied, “i can hardly say that i am surprised. i have\n",
      "suspected something of the kind for some time.”\n",
      "“that brings us,” said poirot, “to the information for which i am\n",
      "asking. if any one can give us an idea of the actual sums paid, you are\n",
      "the man, monsieur.”\n",
      "“i see no object in withholding the information,” said hammond, after\n",
      "a moment or two. “during the past year, mrs. ferrars has sold out\n",
      "certain securities, and the money for them was paid into her account\n",
      "and not reinvested. as her income was a large one, and she lived very\n",
      "quietly after her husband’s death, it seems certain that these sums of\n",
      "money were paid away for some special purpose. i once sounded her on\n",
      "the subject, and she said that she was obliged to support several of\n",
      "her husband’s poor relations. i let the matter drop, of course. until\n",
      "now, i have always imagined that the money was paid to some woman who\n",
      "had had a claim on ashley ferrars. i never dreamed that mrs. ferrars\n",
      "herself was involved.”\n",
      "“and the amount?” asked poirot.\n",
      "“in all, i should say the various sums totaled at least twenty thousand\n",
      "pounds.”\n",
      "“twenty thousand pounds!” i exclaimed. “in one year!”\n",
      "“mrs. ferrars was a very wealthy woman,” said poirot dryly. “and the\n",
      "penalty for murder is not a pleasant one.”\n",
      "“is there anything else that i can tell you?” inquired mr. hammond.\n",
      "“i thank you, no,” said poirot, rising. “all my excuses for having\n",
      "deranged you.”\n",
      "“not at all, not at all.”\n",
      "“the word derange,” i remarked, when we were outside again, “is\n",
      "applicable to mental disorder only.”\n",
      "“ah!” cried poirot, “never will my english be quite perfect. a curious\n",
      "language. i should then have said disarranged, _n’est-ce pas_?”\n",
      "“disturbed is the word you had in mind.”\n",
      "“i thank you, my friend. the word exact, you are zealous for it. _eh\n",
      "bien_, what about our friend parker now? with twenty thousand pounds\n",
      "in hand, would he have continued being a butler? _je ne pense pas._ it\n",
      "is, of course, possible that he banked the money under another name,\n",
      "but i am disposed to believe he spoke the truth to us. if he is a\n",
      "scoundrel, he is a scoundrel on a mean scale. he has not the big ideas.\n",
      "that leaves us as a possibility, raymond, or—well—major blunt.”\n",
      "“surely not raymond,” i objected. “since we know that he was\n",
      "desperately hard up for a matter of five hundred pounds.”\n",
      "“that is what he says, yes.”\n",
      "“and as to hector blunt——”\n",
      "“i will tell you something as to the good major blunt,” interrupted\n",
      "poirot. “it is my business to make inquiries. i make them. _eh\n",
      "bien_—that legacy of which he speaks, i have discovered that the amount\n",
      "of it was close upon twenty thousand pounds. what do you think of that?”\n",
      "i was so taken aback that i could hardly speak.\n",
      "“it’s impossible,” i said at last. “a well-known man like hector blunt.”\n",
      "poirot shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "“who knows? at least he is a man with big ideas. i confess that i\n",
      "hardly see him as a blackmailer, but there is another possibility that\n",
      "you have not even considered.”\n",
      "“what is that?”\n",
      "“the fire, my friend. ackroyd himself may have destroyed that letter,\n",
      "blue envelope and all, after you left him.”\n",
      "“i hardly think that likely,” i said slowly. “and yet—of course, it\n",
      "may be so. he might have changed his mind.”\n",
      "we had just arrived at my house, and on the spur of the moment i\n",
      "invited poirot to come in and take pot luck.\n",
      "i thought caroline would be pleased with me, but it is hard to satisfy\n",
      "one’s women folk. it appears that we were eating chops for lunch—the\n",
      "kitchen staff being regaled on tripe and onions. and two chops set\n",
      "before three people are productive of embarrassment.\n",
      "but caroline is seldom daunted for long. with magnificent mendacity,\n",
      "she explained to poirot that although james laughed at her for\n",
      "doing so, she adhered strictly to a vegetarian diet. she descanted\n",
      "ecstatically on the delights of nut cutlets (which i am quite sure\n",
      "she has never tasted) and ate a welsh rarebit with gusto and frequent\n",
      "cutting remarks as to the dangers of “flesh” foods.\n",
      "afterwards, when we were sitting in front of the fire and smoking,\n",
      "caroline attacked poirot directly.\n",

      "“where should i find him, mademoiselle?”\n",
      "“i thought, perhaps, you’d found him in cranchester,” said caroline,\n",
      "with intense meaning in her tone.\n",
      "poirot looked merely bewildered.\n",
      "“in cranchester? but why in cranchester?”\n",
      "i enlightened him with a touch of malice.\n",
      "“one of our ample staff of private detectives happened to see you in a\n",
      "car on the cranchester road yesterday,” i explained.\n",
      "poirot’s bewilderment vanished. he laughed heartily.\n",

      "aches. i go there. my tooth, it is at once better. i think to return\n",
      "quickly. the dentist, he says no. better to have it out. i argue. he\n",

      "“ah!” said poirot. “but weakness, where does it end?”\n",
      "“exactly,” said caroline. “take james here—weak as water, if i weren’t\n",
      "about to look after him.”\n",
      "“my dear caroline,” i said irritably, “can’t you talk without dragging\n",
      "in personalities?”\n",
      "“you _are_ weak, james,” said caroline, quite unmoved. “i’m eight years\n",
      "older than you are—oh! i don’t mind m. poirot knowing that——”\n",
      "“i should never have guessed it, mademoiselle,” said poirot, with a\n",
      "gallant little bow.\n",
      "“eight years older. but i’ve always considered it my duty to look after\n",

      "on arrival at liverpool i was surprised to find that poirot was\n",

      "after some further parley, we were taken to interview the prisoner.\n",
      "he was a young fellow, i should say not more than twenty-two or\n",

      "had all along cherished the illusion that there was something familiar\n",
      "about the figure i had met that night, but if this were indeed he, i\n",

      "“you were there that night,” said poirot quietly.\n",
      "“how do you know, mister?”\n",
      "“by this.” poirot took something from his pocket and held it out.\n",
      "it was the goose quill we had found in the summer-house.\n",
      "at the sight of it the man’s face changed. he half held out his hand.\n",
      "“snow,” said poirot thoughtfully. “no, my friend, it is empty. it lay\n",

      "charles kent looked at him uncertainly.\n",
      "“you seem to know a hell of a lot about everything, you little foreign\n",
      "cock duck. perhaps you remember this: the papers say that the old gent\n",
      "was croaked between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock?”\n",
      "“that is so,” agreed poirot.\n",
      "“yes, but is it really so? that’s what i’m getting at.”\n",
      "“this gentleman will tell you,” said poirot.\n",
      "he indicated inspector raglan. the latter hesitated, glanced at\n",
      "superintendent hayes, then at poirot, and finally, as though receiving\n",
      "sanction, he said:—\n",
      "“that’s right. between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock.”\n",
      "“then you’ve nothing to keep me here for,” said kent. “i was away from\n",
      "fernly park by twenty-five minutes past nine. you can ask at the dog\n",
      "and whistle. that’s a saloon about a mile out of fernly on the road to\n",
      "cranchester. i kicked up a bit of a row there, i remember. as near as\n",
      "nothing to quarter to ten, it was. how about that?”\n",

      "“well?” demanded kent.\n",
      "“inquiries will be made,” said the inspector. “if you’ve spoken the\n",
      "truth, you won’t have anything to complain about. what were you doing\n",
      "at fernly park anyway?”\n",

      "that’s all there is to it. if i was clear away before the murder was\n",
      "done, that’s all that concerns the cops.”\n",
      "“your name, it is charles kent,” said poirot. “where were you born?”\n",
      "the man stared at him, then he grinned.\n",
      "“i’m a full-blown britisher all right,” he said.\n",
      "“yes,” said poirot meditatively, “i think you are. i fancy you were\n",
      "born in kent.”\n",
      "the man stared.\n",
      "“why’s that? because of my name? what’s that to do with it? is a man\n",

      "“under certain circumstances, i can imagine he might be,” said poirot\n",
      "very deliberately. “under certain circumstances, you comprehend.”\n",
      "there was so much meaning in his voice as to surprise the two police\n",
      "officers. as for charles kent, he flushed a brick red, and for a moment\n",
      "i thought he was going to spring at poirot. he thought better of it,\n",
      "however, and turned away with a kind of laugh.\n",
      "poirot nodded as though satisfied, and made his way out through the\n",
      "door. he was joined presently by the two officers.\n",
      "“we’ll verify that statement,” remarked raglan. “i don’t think he’s\n",
      "lying, though. but he’s got to come clear with a statement as to\n",
      "what he was doing at fernly. it looks to me as though we’d got our\n",
      "blackmailer all right. on the other hand, granted his story’s correct,\n",
      "he couldn’t have had anything to do with the actual murder. he’d got\n",
      "ten pounds on him when he was arrested—rather a large sum. i fancy that\n",
      "forty pounds went to him—the numbers of the notes didn’t correspond,\n",
      "but of course he’d have changed them first thing. mr. ackroyd must\n",
      "have given him the money, and he made off with it as fast as possible.\n",
      "what was that about kent being his birthplace? what’s that got to do\n",
      "with it?”\n",
      "“nothing whatever,” said poirot mildly. “a little idea of mine, that\n",
      "was all. me, i am famous for my little ideas.”\n",
      "“are you really?” said raglan, studying him with a puzzled expression.\n",
      "the superintendent went into a roar of laughter.\n",
      "“many’s the time i’ve heard inspector japp say that. m. poirot and his\n",
      "little ideas! too fanciful for me, he’d say, but always something in\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "“you mock yourself at me,” said poirot, smiling; “but never mind. the\n",
      "old ones they laugh last sometimes, when the young, clever ones do not\n",
      "laugh at all.”\n",
      "and nodding his head at them in a sage manner, he walked out into the\n",
      "street.\n",
      "he and i lunched together at an hotel. i know now that the whole thing\n",
      "lay clearly unravelled before him. he had got the last thread he needed\n",
      "to lead him to the truth.\n",
      "but at the time i had no suspicion of the fact. i overestimated his\n",
      "general self-confidence, and i took it for granted that the things\n",
      "which puzzled me must be equally puzzling to him.\n",
      "my chief puzzle was what the man charles kent could have been doing at\n",
      "fernly. again and again i put the question to myself and could get no\n",
      "satisfactory reply.\n",
      "at last i ventured a tentative query to poirot. his reply was immediate.\n",
      "“_mon ami_, i do not think; i know.”\n",
      "“really?” i said incredulously.\n",
      "“yes, indeed. i suppose now that to you it would not make sense if i\n",

      "captain paton to please her uncle, and because she saw in the marriage\n",
      "a way of escape from her life here which was becoming frankly\n",
      "insupportable to her. she liked him, and there was much sympathy\n",

      "“charles kent has been arrested at liverpool.”\n",
      "not a muscle of her face moved. she merely opened her eyes a trifle\n",
      "wider, and asked, with a tinge of defiance:\n",
      "“well, what of it?”\n",
      "but at that moment it came to me—the resemblance that had haunted me\n",
      "all along, something familiar in the defiance of charles kent’s manner.\n",
      "the two voices, one rough and coarse, the other painfully ladylike—were\n",
      "strangely the same in timbre. it was of miss russell that i had been\n",
      "reminded that night outside the gates of fernly park.\n",

      "imperceptible nod.\n",
      "in answer to miss russell’s question, he threw out his hands in a\n",
      "thoroughly french gesture.\n",
      "“i thought you might be interested, that is all,” he said mildly.\n",
      "“well, i’m not particularly,” said miss russell. “who is this charles\n",
      "kent anyway?”\n",
      "“he is a man, mademoiselle, who was at fernly on the night of the\n",
      "murder.”\n",

      "“nothing came to _my_ ears. if that is all——”\n",
      "she made a tentative movement as though to rise. poirot stopped her.\n",
      "“it is not quite all,” he said smoothly. “this morning fresh\n",
      "developments have arisen. it seems now that mr. ackroyd was murdered,\n",
      "not at a quarter to ten, but _before_. between ten minutes to nine,\n",
      "when dr. sheppard left, and a quarter to ten.”\n",
      "i saw the color drain from the housekeeper’s face, leaving it dead\n",
      "white. she leaned forward, her figure swaying.\n",

      "doing there——”\n",
      "“i can tell you what he was doing there. he never touched a hair of old\n",

      "last. terror and desperation were in her face.\n",
      "“m. poirot! m. poirot! oh, do believe me.”\n",
      "poirot got up and came to her. he patted her reassuringly on the\n",

      "“but yes—but yes, i will believe. i had to make you speak, you know.”\n",
      "for an instant suspicion flared up in her.\n",
      "“is what you said true?”\n",
      "“that charles kent is suspected of the crime? yes, that is true. you\n",
      "alone can save him, by telling the reason for his being at fernly.”\n",
      "“he came to see me.” she spoke in a low, hurried voice. “i went out to\n",

      "“in the summer-house, yes, i know.”\n",
      "“how do you know?”\n",
      "“mademoiselle, it is the business of hercule poirot to know things. i\n",

      "in the summer-house to say what time you would be there.”\n",
      "“yes, i did. i had heard from him—saying he was coming. i dared not\n",
      "let him come to the house. i wrote to the address he gave me and said\n",
      "i would meet him in the summer-house, and described it to him so that\n",
      "he would be able to find it. then i was afraid he might not wait there\n",
      "patiently, and i ran out and left a piece of paper to say i would be\n",
      "there about ten minutes past nine. i didn’t want the servants to see\n",
      "me, so i slipped out through the drawing-room window. as i came back, i\n",
      "met dr. sheppard, and i fancied that he would think it queer. i was out\n",
      "of breath, for i had been running. i had no idea that he was expected\n",
      "to dinner that night.”\n",
      "she paused.\n",
      "“go on,” said poirot. “you went out to meet him at ten minutes past\n",
      "nine. what did you say to each other?”\n",
      "“it’s difficult. you see——”\n",
      "“mademoiselle,” said poirot, interrupting her, “in this matter i must\n",
      "have the whole truth. what you tell us need never go beyond these four\n",
      "walls. dr. sheppard will be discreet, and so shall i. see, i will help\n",
      "you. this charles kent, he is your son, is he not?”\n",
      "she nodded. the color had flamed into her cheeks.\n",
      "“no one has ever known. it was long ago—long ago—down in kent. i was\n",
      "not married....”\n",
      "“so you took the name of the county as a surname for him. i understand.”\n",
      "“i got work. i managed to pay for his board and lodging. i never told\n",
      "him that i was his mother. but he turned out badly, he drank, then took\n",
      "to drugs. i managed to pay his passage out to canada. i didn’t hear of\n",
      "him for a year or two. then, somehow or other, he found out that i was\n",
      "his mother. he wrote asking me for money. finally, i heard from him\n",
      "back in this country again. he was coming to see me at fernly, he said.\n",
      "i dared not let him come to the house. i have always been considered\n",
      "so—so very respectable. if any one got an inkling—it would have been\n",
      "all up with my post as housekeeper. so i wrote to him in the way i have\n",
      "just told you.”\n",
      "“and in the morning you came to see dr. sheppard?”\n",
      "“yes. i wondered if something could be done. he was not a bad\n",
      "boy—before he took to drugs.”\n",
      "“i see,” said poirot. “now let us go on with the story. he came that\n",
      "night to the summer-house?”\n",
      "“yes, he was waiting for me when i got there. he was very rough and\n",
      "abusive. i had brought with me all the money i had, and i gave it to\n",
      "him. we talked a little, and then he went away.”\n",
      "“what time was that?”\n",
      "“it must have been between twenty and twenty-five minutes past nine. it\n",
      "was not yet half-past when i got back to the house.”\n",
      "“which way did he go?”\n",
      "“straight out the same way he came, by the path that joined the drive\n",
      "just inside the lodge gates.”\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“and you, what did you do?”\n",
      "“i went back to the house. major blunt was walking up and down the\n",
      "terrace smoking, so i made a detour to get round to the side door. it\n",
      "was then just on half-past nine, as i tell you.”\n",
      "poirot nodded again. he made a note or two in a microscopic pocket-book.\n",
      "“i think that is all,” he said thoughtfully.\n",
      "“ought i——” she hesitated. “ought i to tell all this to inspector\n",
      "raglan?”\n",
      "“it may come to that. but let us not be in a hurry. let us proceed\n",
      "slowly, with due order and method. charles kent is not yet formally\n",
      "charged with murder. circumstances may arise which will render your\n",
      "story unnecessary.”\n",
      "miss russell rose.\n",
      "“thank you very much, m. poirot,” she said. “you have been very\n",
      "kind—very kind indeed. you—you do believe me, don’t you? that charles\n",
      "had nothing to do with this wicked murder!”\n",
      "“there seems no doubt that the man who was talking to mr. ackroyd in\n",

      "good courage, mademoiselle. all will yet be well.”\n",
      "miss russell departed. poirot and i were left together.\n",
      "“so that’s that,” i said. “every time we come back to ralph paton. how\n",
      "did you manage to spot miss russell as the person charles kent came to\n",
      "meet? did you notice the resemblance?”\n",
      "“i had connected her with the unknown man long before we actually\n",
      "came face to face with him. as soon as we found that quill. the quill\n",
      "suggested dope, and i remembered your account of miss russell’s visit\n",
      "to you. then i found the article on cocaine in that morning’s paper. it\n",
      "all seemed very clear. she had heard from some one that morning—some\n",
      "one addicted to drugs, she read the article in the paper, and she came\n",
      "to you to ask a few tentative questions. she mentioned cocaine, since\n",
      "the article in question was on cocaine. then, when you seemed too\n",
      "interested, she switched hurriedly to the subject of detective stories\n",
      "and untraceable poisons. i suspected a son or a brother, or some other\n",
      "undesirable male relation. ah! but i must go. it is the time of the\n",

      "“stay and lunch with us,” i suggested.\n",

      "“not again to-day. i should not like to force mademoiselle caroline to\n",

      "caroline, of course, had not failed to see miss russell come\n",
      "to the surgery door. i had anticipated this, and had ready an\n",
      "elaborate account of the lady’s bad knee. but caroline was not in a\n",
      "cross-questioning mood. her point of view was that she knew what miss\n",
      "russell had really come for and that _i_ didn’t.\n",
      "“pumping you, james,” said caroline. “pumping you in the most shameless\n",
      "manner, i’ve not a doubt. it’s no good interrupting. i dare say you\n",
      "hadn’t the least idea she was doing it even. men _are_ so simple. she\n",
      "knows that you are in m. poirot’s confidence, and she wants to find out\n",
      "things. do you know what i think, james?”\n",
      "“i couldn’t begin to imagine. you think so many extraordinary things.”\n",
      "“it’s no good being sarcastic. i think miss russell knows more about\n",
      "mr. ackroyd’s death than she is prepared to admit.”\n",
      "caroline leaned back triumphantly in her chair.\n",
      "“do you really think so?” i said absently.\n",

      "our conversation then dealt with purely personal matters.\n",
      "the paragraph inspired by poirot duly appeared in our daily paper the\n",
      "next morning. i was in the dark as to its purpose, but its effect on\n",
      "caroline was immense.\n",
      "she began by stating, most untruly, that she had said as much all\n",
      "along. i raised my eyebrows, but did not argue. caroline, however, must\n",
      "have felt a prick of conscience, for she went on:—\n",
      "“i mayn’t have actually mentioned liverpool, but i knew he’d try to get\n",
      "away to america. that’s what crippen did.”\n",
      "“without much success,” i reminded her.\n",
      "“poor boy, and so they’ve caught him. i consider, james, that it’s your\n",

      "“what do you expect me to do?”\n",
      "“why, you’re a medical man, aren’t you? you’ve known him from a boy\n",
      "upwards. not mentally responsible. that’s the line to take, clearly. i\n",
      "read only the other day that they’re very happy in broadmoor—it’s quite\n",
      "like a high-class club.”\n",
      "but caroline’s words had reminded me of something.\n",
      "“i never knew that poirot had an imbecile nephew?” i said curiously.\n",
      "“didn’t you? oh, he told me all about it. poor lad. it’s a great grief\n",
      "to all the family. they’ve kept him at home so far, but it’s getting\n",
      "to such a pitch that they’re afraid he’ll have to go into some kind of\n",
      "institution.”\n",
      "“i suppose you know pretty well everything there is to know about\n",
      "poirot’s family by this time,” i said, exasperated.\n",
      "“pretty well,” said caroline complacently. “it’s a great relief to\n",
      "people to be able to tell all their troubles to some one.”\n",
      "“it might be,” i said, “if they were ever allowed to do so\n",
      "spontaneously. whether they enjoy having confidences screwed out of\n",
      "them by force is another matter.”\n",
      "caroline merely looked at me with the air of a christian martyr\n",
      "enjoying martyrdom.\n",
      "“you are so self-contained, james,” she said. “you hate speaking out,\n",
      "or parting with any information yourself, and you think everybody else\n",
      "must be just like you. i should hope that i never screw confidences out\n",
      "of anybody. for instance, if m. poirot comes in this afternoon, as he\n",
      "said he might do, i shall not dream of asking him who it was arrived at\n",
      "his house early this morning.”\n",
      "“early this morning?” i queried.\n",
      "“very early,” said caroline. “before the milk came. i just happened\n",
      "to be looking out of the window—the blind was flapping. it was a man.\n",
      "he came in a closed car, and he was all muffled up. i couldn’t get a\n",
      "glimpse of his face. but i will tell you _my_ idea, and you’ll see that\n",
      "i’m right.”\n",
      "“what’s your idea?”\n",
      "caroline dropped her voice mysteriously.\n",
      "“a home office expert,” she breathed.\n",
      "“a home office expert,” i said, amazed. “my dear caroline!”\n",
      "“mark my words, james, you’ll see that i’m right. that russell woman\n",
      "was here that morning after your poisons. roger ackroyd might easily\n",
      "have been poisoned in his food that night.”\n",
      "i laughed out loud.\n",
      "“nonsense,” i cried. “he was stabbed in the neck. you know that as well\n",
      "as i do.”\n",
      "“after death, james,” said caroline; “to make a false clew.”\n",
      "“my good woman,” i said, “i examined the body, and i know what i’m\n",
      "talking about. that wound wasn’t inflicted after death—it was the cause\n",
      "of death, and you need make no mistake about it.”\n",
      "caroline merely continued to look omniscient, which so annoyed me that\n",
      "i went on:—\n",
      "“perhaps you will tell me, caroline, if i have a medical degree or if i\n",
      "have not?”\n",
      "“you have the medical degree, i dare say, james—at least, i mean i know\n",
      "you have. but you’ve no imagination whatever.”\n",
      "“having endowed you with a treble portion, there was none left over for\n",
      "me,” i said dryly.\n",
      "i was amused to notice caroline’s maneuvers that afternoon when poirot\n",
      "duly arrived. my sister, without asking a direct question, skirted the\n",
      "subject of the mysterious guest in every way imaginable. by the twinkle\n",
      "in poirot’s eyes, i saw that he realized her object. he remained\n",
      "blandly impervious, and blocked her bowling so successfully that she\n",
      "herself was at a loss how to proceed.\n",
      "having, i suspect, quietly enjoyed the little game, he rose to his feet\n",
      "and suggested a walk.\n",
      "“it is that i need to reduce the figure a little,” he explained. “you\n",
      "will come with me, doctor? and perhaps later miss caroline will give us\n",
      "some tea.”\n",
      "“delighted,” said caroline. “won’t your—er—guest come in also?”\n",
      "“you are too kind,” said poirot. “but no, my friend reposes himself.\n",
      "soon you must make his acquaintance.”\n",
      "“quite an old friend of yours, so somebody told me,” said caroline,\n",
      "making one last valiant effort.\n",
      "“did they?” murmured poirot. “well, we must start.”\n",
      "our tramp took us in the direction of fernly. i had guessed beforehand\n",
      "that it might do so. i was beginning to understand poirot’s methods.\n",
      "every little irrelevancy had a bearing upon the whole.\n",
      "“i have a commission for you, my friend,” he said at last. “to-night,\n",
      "at my house, i desire to have a little conference. you will attend,\n",
      "will you not?”\n",
      "“certainly,” i said.\n",
      "“good. i need also all those in the house—that is to say: mrs. ackroyd,\n",
      "mademoiselle flora, major blunt, m. raymond. i want you to be my\n",
      "ambassador. this little reunion is fixed for nine o’clock. you will ask\n",
      "them—yes?”\n",
      "“with pleasure; but why not ask them yourself?”\n",
      "“because they will then put the questions: why? what for? they will\n",
      "demand what my idea is. and, as you know, my friend, i much dislike to\n",
      "have to explain my little ideas until the time comes.”\n",
      "i smiled a little.\n",
      "“my friend hastings, he of whom i told you, used to say of me that i\n",
      "was the human oyster. but he was unjust. of facts, i keep nothing to\n",
      "myself. but to every one his own interpretation of them.”\n",
      "“when do you want me to do this?”\n",
      "“now, if you will. we are close to the house.”\n",
      "“aren’t you coming in?”\n",
      "“no, me, i will promenade myself in the grounds. i will rejoin you by\n",
      "the lodge gates in a quarter of an hour’s time.”\n",
      "i nodded, and set off on my task. the only member of the family at home\n",
      "proved to be mrs. ackroyd, who was sipping an early cup of tea. she\n",
      "received me very graciously.\n",
      "“so grateful to you, doctor,” she murmured, “for clearing up that\n",
      "little matter with m. poirot. but life is one trouble after another.\n",
      "you have heard about flora, of course?”\n",
      "“what exactly?” i asked cautiously.\n",
      "“this new engagement. flora and hector blunt. of course not such a good\n",
      "match as ralph would have been. but after all, happiness comes first.\n",
      "what dear flora needs is an older man—some one steady and reliable, and\n",
      "then hector is really a very distinguished man in his way. you saw the\n",
      "news of ralph’s arrest in the paper this morning?”\n",
      "“yes,” i said, “i did.”\n",
      "“horrible.” mrs. ackroyd closed her eyes and shuddered. “geoffrey\n",

      "a mistake—a—what do they call it?—_canard_ of the newspaper’s. i’ve\n",
      "forbidden it to be mentioned before the servants. such a terrible\n",
      "disgrace. fancy if flora had actually been married to him.”\n",

      "“you were here yesterday, weren’t you, with that dreadful inspector\n",
      "raglan? brute of a man—he terrified flora into saying she took that\n",
      "money from poor roger’s room. and the matter was so simple, really. the\n",
      "dear child wanted to borrow a few pounds, didn’t like to disturb her\n",
      "uncle since he’d given strict orders against it, but knowing where he\n",
      "kept his notes she went there and took what she needed.”\n",
      "“is that flora’s account of the matter?” i asked.\n",
      "“my dear doctor, you know what girls are nowadays. so easily acted on\n",
      "by suggestion. you, of course, know all about hypnosis and that sort of\n",
      "thing. the inspector shouts at her, says the word ‘steal’ over and over\n",
      "again, until the poor child gets an inhibition—or is it a complex?—i\n",
      "always mix up those two words—and actually thinks herself that she has\n",
      "stolen the money. i saw at once how it was. but i can’t be too thankful\n",
      "for the whole misunderstanding in one way—it seems to have brought\n",
      "those two together—hector and flora, i mean. and i assure you that i\n",
      "have been very much worried about flora in the past: why, at one time\n",
      "i actually thought there was going to be some kind of understanding\n",

      "you’ll see—everything will be all right.”\n",
      "buried under curiosity and scandal-mongering there is a lot of kindness\n",
      "in caroline. for the moment, even the interest of poirot’s revelation\n",
      "was lost in the sight of the girl’s distress.\n",
      "presently ursula sat up and wiped her eyes.\n",
      "“this is very weak and silly of me,” she said.\n",
      "“no, no, my child,” said poirot kindly. “we can all realize the strain\n",
      "of this last week.”\n",
      "“it must have been a terrible ordeal,” i said.\n",

      "poirot shook his head.\n",
      "“you know what brought me to you to-night,” went on the girl. “_this_——”\n",
      "she held out a crumpled piece of newspaper, and i recognized the\n",
      "paragraph that poirot had had inserted.\n",
      "“it says that ralph has been arrested. so everything is useless. i need\n",
      "not pretend any longer.”\n",
      "“newspaper paragraphs are not always true, mademoiselle,” murmured\n",
      "poirot, having the grace to look ashamed of himself. “all the same, i\n",

      "what we need now.”\n",
      "the girl hesitated, looking at him doubtfully.\n",
      "“you do not trust me,” said poirot gently. “yet all the same you came\n",
      "here to find me, did you not? why was that?”\n",
      "“because i don’t believe that ralph did it,” said the girl in a very\n",
      "low voice. “and i think that you are clever, and will find out the\n",
      "truth. and also——”\n",
      "“yes?”\n",
      "“i think you are kind.”\n",
      "poirot nodded his head several times.\n",

      "“you’re not going to send _me_ away, i hope,” said caroline, settling\n",
      "herself comfortably in an arm-chair. “what i want to know,” she\n",
      "continued, “is why this child was masquerading as a parlormaid?”\n",
      "“masquerading?” i queried.\n",
      "“that’s what i said. why did you do it, child? for a wager?”\n",
      "“for a living,” said ursula dryly.\n",
      "and encouraged, she began the story which i reproduce here in my own\n",
      "words.\n",
      "ursula bourne, it seemed, was one of a family of seven—impoverished\n",
      "irish gentlefolk. on the death of her father, most of the girls were\n",
      "cast out into the world to earn their own living. ursula’s eldest\n",
      "sister was married to captain folliott. it was she whom i had seen\n",
      "that sunday, and the cause of her embarrassment was clear enough now.\n",
      "determined to earn her living and not attracted to the idea of being a\n",
      "nursery governess—the one profession open to an untrained girl, ursula\n",
      "preferred the job of parlormaid. she scorned to label herself a “lady\n",
      "parlormaid.” she would be the real thing, her reference being supplied\n",
      "by her sister. at fernly, despite an aloofness which, as has been seen,\n",
      "caused some comment, she was a success at her job—quick, competent, and\n",
      "thorough.\n",
      "“i enjoyed the work,” she explained. “and i had plenty of time to\n",
      "myself.”\n",
      "and then came her meeting with ralph paton, and the love affair which\n",
      "culminated in a secret marriage. ralph had persuaded her into that,\n",
      "somewhat against her will. he had declared that his stepfather would\n",
      "not hear of his marrying a penniless girl. better to be married\n",
      "secretly, and break the news to him at some later and more favorable\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "and so the deed was done, and ursula bourne became ursula paton.\n",
      "ralph had declared that he meant to pay off his debts, find a job, and\n",
      "then, when he was in a position to support her, and independent of his\n",
      "adopted father, they would break the news to him.\n",
      "but to people like ralph paton, turning over a new leaf is easier in\n",
      "theory than in practice. he hoped that his stepfather, whilst still\n",
      "in ignorance of the marriage, might be persuaded to pay his debts and\n",
      "put him on his feet again. but the revelation of the amount of ralph’s\n",
      "liabilities merely enraged roger ackroyd, and he refused to do anything\n",
      "at all. some months passed, and then ralph was bidden once more to\n",
      "fernly. roger ackroyd did not beat about the bush. it was the desire of\n",
      "his heart that ralph should marry flora, and he put the matter plainly\n",
      "before the young man.\n",
      "and here it was that the innate weakness of ralph paton showed itself.\n",
      "as always, he grasped at the easy, the immediate solution. as far\n",
      "as i could make out, neither flora nor ralph made any pretence of\n",
      "love. it was, on both sides, a business arrangement. roger ackroyd\n",
      "dictated his wishes—they agreed to them. flora accepted a chance of\n",
      "liberty, money, and an enlarged horizon, ralph, of course, was playing\n",
      "a different game. but he was in a very awkward hole financially. he\n",
      "seized at the chance. his debts would be paid. he could start again\n",
      "with a clean sheet. his was not a nature to envisage the future, but\n",
      "i gather that he saw vaguely the engagement with flora being broken\n",
      "off after a decent interval had elapsed. both flora and he stipulated\n",
      "that it should be kept a secret for the present. he was anxious to\n",
      "conceal it from ursula. he felt instinctively that her nature, strong\n",
      "and resolute, with an inherent distaste for duplicity, was not one to\n",
      "welcome such a course.\n",
      "then came the crucial moment when roger ackroyd, always high-handed,\n",
      "decided to announce the engagement. he said no word of his intention\n",

      "enough, however. ackroyd was not the kind of man to forgive the deceit\n",
      "that had been practiced upon him. his rancor was mainly directed to\n",
      "ralph, but ursula came in for her share, since he regarded her as a\n",

      "ursula paton. small wonder the girl had held her tongue, and played her\n",
      "part so consistently.\n",
      "my meditations were interrupted. it was poirot’s voice speaking, and i\n",
      "knew from the gravity of his tone that he, too, was fully alive to the\n",
      "implications of the position.\n",
      "“mademoiselle, i must ask you one question, and you must answer it\n",
      "truthfully, for on it everything may hang: what time was it when you\n",
      "parted from captain ralph paton in the summer-house? now, take a little\n",
      "minute so that your answer may be very exact.”\n",
      "the girl gave a half laugh, bitter enough in all conscience.\n",
      "“do you think i haven’t gone over that again and again in my own mind?\n",
      "it was just half-past nine when i went out to meet him. major blunt\n",
      "was walking up and down the terrace, so i had to go round through the\n",
      "bushes to avoid him. it must have been about twenty-seven minutes to\n",
      "ten when i reached the summer-house. ralph was waiting for me. i was\n",
      "with him ten minutes—not longer, for it was just a quarter to ten when\n",
      "i got back to the house.”\n",
      "i saw now the insistence of her question the other day. if only ackroyd\n",
      "could have been proved to have been killed before a quarter to ten, and\n",
      "not after.\n",
      "i saw the reflection of that thought in poirot’s next question.\n",
      "“who left the summer-house first?”\n",
      "“i did.”\n",
      "“leaving ralph paton in the summer-house?”\n",

      "when you got back to the house?”\n",
      "“i went up to my room.”\n",
      "“and stayed there until when?”\n",
      "“until about ten o’clock.”\n",
      "“is there any one who can prove that?”\n",
      "“prove? that i was in my room, you mean? oh! no. but surely—oh! i see,\n",
      "they might think—they might think——”\n",
      "i saw the dawning horror in her eyes.\n",
      "poirot finished the sentence for her.\n",
      "“that it was _you_ who entered by the window and stabbed mr. ackroyd as\n",
      "he sat in his chair? yes, they might think just that.”\n",
      "“nobody but a fool would think any such thing,” said caroline\n",

      "so candidly. running away and leaving you to face the music.”\n",

      "“oh, no,” she cried. “it wasn’t like that at all. ralph would not run\n",
      "away on his own account. i see now. if he heard of his stepfather’s\n",

      "i just stood there telling him what i thought of him, and saying the\n",
      "coldest, cruelest things that came into my mind—trying my best to hurt\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "“do him no harm,” said caroline. “never worry about what you say to a\n",
      "man. they’re so conceited that they never believe you mean it if it’s\n",

      "terribly upset. just for a moment i wondered—but then i knew he\n",
      "couldn’t—he couldn’t.... but i wished he would come forward and say\n",
      "openly that he’d had nothing to do with it. i knew that he was very\n",
      "fond of dr. sheppard, and i fancied that perhaps dr. sheppard might\n",
      "know where he was hiding.”\n",
      "she turned to me.\n",
      "“that’s why i said what i did to you that day. i thought, if you knew\n",
      "where he was, you might pass on the message to him.”\n",
      "“i?” i exclaimed.\n",
      "“why should james know where he was?” demanded caroline sharply.\n",
      "“it was very unlikely, i know,” admitted ursula, “but ralph had often\n",
      "spoken of dr. sheppard, and i knew that he would be likely to consider\n",
      "him as his best friend in king’s abbot.”\n",
      "“my dear child,” i said, “i have not the least idea where ralph paton\n",
      "is at the present moment.”\n",
      "“that is true enough,” said poirot.\n",
      "“but——” ursula held out the newspaper cutting in a puzzled fashion.\n",
      "“ah! that,” said poirot, slightly embarrassed; “a _bagatelle_,\n",
      "mademoiselle. a _rien du tout_. not for a moment do i believe that\n",
      "ralph paton has been arrested.”\n",
      "“but then——” began the girl slowly.\n",
      "poirot went on quickly:—\n",
      "“there is one thing i should like to know—did captain paton wear shoes\n",
      "or boots that night?”\n",
      "ursula shook her head.\n",
      "“i can’t remember.”\n",
      "“a pity! but how should you? now, madame,” he smiled at her, his head\n",
      "on one side, his forefinger wagging eloquently, “no questions. and\n",

      "you—be sure of that.”\n",
      "“i ought to go back to fernly,” said ursula uncertainly.\n",
      "but caroline silenced her protests with a firm hand.\n",
      "“nonsense. you’re in my hands for the time being. you’ll stay here for\n",
      "the present, anyway—eh, m. poirot?”\n",
      "“it will be the best plan,” agreed the little belgian. “this evening i\n",

      "i looked at him, slightly puzzled by the remark. he was leaning back in\n",
      "the chair, his eyes half closed, the tips of his fingers just touching\n",
      "each other. suddenly he sighed and shook his head.\n",
      "“what is it?” i asked.\n",
      "“it is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend\n",

      "helped me. for he had a knack, that one, of stumbling over the truth\n",
      "unawares—without noticing it himself, _bien entendu_. at times he has\n",
      "said something particularly foolish, and behold that foolish remark has\n",
      "revealed the truth to me! and then, too, it was his practice to keep a\n",
      "written record of the cases that proved interesting.”\n",
      "i gave a slight embarrassed cough.\n",
      "“as far as that goes,” i began, and then stopped.\n",
      "poirot sat upright in his chair. his eyes sparkled.\n",
      "“but yes? what is it that you would say?”\n",
      "“well, as a matter of fact, i’ve read some of captain hastings’s\n",
      "narratives, and i thought, why not try my hand at something of the same\n",
      "kind? seemed a pity not to—unique opportunity—probably the only time\n",
      "i’ll be mixed up with anything of this kind.”\n",
      "i felt myself getting hotter and hotter, and more and more incoherent,\n",
      "as i floundered through the above speech.\n",
      "poirot sprang from his chair. i had a moment’s terror that he was going\n",
      "to embrace me french fashion, but mercifully he refrained.\n",
      "“but this is magnificent—you have then written down your impressions of\n",
      "the case as you went along?”\n",
      "i nodded.\n",
      "“_epatant!_” cried poirot. “let me see them—this instant.”\n",
      "i was not quite prepared for such a sudden demand. i racked my brains\n",
      "to remember certain details.\n",
      "“i hope you won’t mind,” i stammered. “i may have been a\n",

      "he also was not always polite. me, i have the mind above such\n",
      "trivialities.”\n",
      "still somewhat doubtful, i rummaged in the drawers of my desk and\n",
      "produced an untidy pile of manuscript which i handed over to him. with\n",
      "an eye on possible publication in the future, i had divided the work\n",
      "into chapters, and the night before i had brought it up to date with an\n",
      "account of miss russell’s visit. poirot had therefore twenty chapters.\n",
      "i left him with them.\n",
      "i was obliged to go out to a case at some distance away, and it was\n",
      "past eight o’clock when i got back, to be greeted with a plate of hot\n",
      "dinner on a tray, and the announcement that poirot and my sister had\n",
      "supped together at half-past seven, and that the former had then gone\n",
      "to my workshop to finish his reading of the manuscript.\n",
      "“i hope, james,” said my sister, “that you’ve been careful in what you\n",

      "my jaw dropped. i had not been careful at all.\n",

      "correctly. “m. poirot will know what to think. he understands me much\n",
      "better than you do.”\n",
      "i went into the workshop. poirot was sitting by the window. the\n",

      "i blushed a little before the twinkle in his eye.\n",
      "“what do you really think of the stuff?” i asked nervously.\n",

      "“yes. i may say that it has helped me considerably. come, we must go\n",
      "over to my house and set the stage for my little performance.”\n",
      "caroline was in the hall. i think she hoped that she might be invited\n",
      "to accompany us. poirot dealt with the situation tactfully.\n",
      "“i should much like to have had you present, mademoiselle,” he said\n",
      "regretfully, “but at this juncture it would not be wise. see you, all\n",
      "these people to-night are suspects. amongst them, i shall find the\n",
      "person who killed mr. ackroyd.”\n",
      "“you really believe that?” i said incredulously.\n",
      "“i see that you do not,” said poirot dryly. “not yet do you appreciate\n",
      "hercule poirot at his true worth.”\n",
      "at that minute ursula came down the staircase.\n",
      "“you are ready, my child?” said poirot. “that is good. we will go to\n",
      "my house together. mademoiselle caroline, believe me, i do everything\n",
      "possible to render you service. good-evening.”\n",
      "we went out, leaving caroline, rather like a dog who has been refused a\n",
      "walk, standing on the front door step gazing after us.\n",
      "the sitting-room at the larches had been got ready. on the table were\n",
      "various _sirops_ and glasses. also a plate of biscuits. several chairs\n",
      "had been brought in from the other room.\n",
      "poirot ran to and fro rearranging things. pulling out a chair here,\n",
      "altering the position of a lamp there, occasionally stooping to\n",
      "straighten one of the mats that covered the floor. he was specially\n",
      "fussy over the lighting. the lamps were arranged in such a way as to\n",
      "throw a clear light on the side of the room where the chairs were\n",
      "grouped, at the same time leaving the other end of the room, where i\n",
      "presumed poirot himself would sit, in a dim twilight.\n",
      "ursula and i watched him. presently a bell was heard.\n",
      "“they arrive,” said poirot. “good, all is in readiness.”\n",
      "the door opened and the party from fernly filed in. poirot went forward\n",
      "and greeted mrs. ackroyd and flora.\n",
      "“it is most good of you to come,” he said. “and major blunt and mr.\n",
      "raymond.”\n",
      "the secretary was debonair as ever.\n",
      "“what’s the great idea?” he said, laughing. “some scientific machine?\n",
      "do we have bands round our wrists which register guilty heart-beats?\n",
      "there is such an invention, isn’t there?”\n",
      "“i have read of it, yes,” admitted poirot. “but me, i am old-fashioned.\n",
      "i use the old methods. i work only with the little gray cells. now let\n",
      "us begin—but first i have an announcement to make to you all.”\n",
      "he took ursula’s hand and drew her forward.\n",
      "“this lady is mrs. ralph paton. she was married to captain paton last\n",
      "march.”\n",
      "a little shriek burst from mrs. ackroyd.\n",
      "“ralph! married! last march! oh! but it’s absurd. how could he be?”\n",
      "she stared at ursula as though she had never seen her before.\n",
      "“married to bourne?” she said. “really, m. poirot, i don’t believe you.”\n",
      "ursula flushed and began to speak, but flora forestalled her.\n",
      "going quickly to the other girl’s side, she passed her hand through her\n",
      "arm.\n",
      "“you must not mind our being surprised,” she said. “you see, we had no\n",
      "idea of such a thing. you and ralph have kept your secret very well. i\n",
      "am—very glad about it.”\n",
      "“you are very kind, miss ackroyd,” said ursula in a low voice, “and\n",
      "you have every right to be exceedingly angry. ralph behaved very\n",
      "badly—especially to you.”\n",
      "“you needn’t worry about that,” said flora, giving her arm a consoling\n",
      "little pat. “ralph was in a corner and took the only way out. i should\n",
      "probably have done the same in his place. i do think he might have\n",
      "trusted me with the secret, though. i wouldn’t have let him down.”\n",
      "poirot rapped gently on a table and cleared his throat significantly.\n",
      "“the board meeting’s going to begin,” said flora. “m. poirot hints that\n",
      "we mustn’t talk. but just tell me one thing. where is ralph? you must\n",
      "know if any one does.”\n",
      "“but i don’t,” cried ursula, almost in a wail. “that’s just it, i\n",
      "don’t.”\n",
      "“isn’t he detained at liverpool?” asked raymond. “it said so in the\n",
      "paper.”\n",
      "“he is not at liverpool,” said poirot shortly.\n",
      "“in fact,” i remarked, “no one knows where he is.”\n",
      "“excepting hercule poirot, eh?” said raymond.\n",
      "poirot replied seriously to the other’s banter.\n",
      "“me, i know everything. remember that.”\n",
      "geoffrey raymond lifted his eyebrows.\n",
      "“everything?” he whistled. “whew! that’s a tall order.”\n",
      "“do you mean to say you can really guess where ralph paton is hiding?”\n",
      "i asked incredulously.\n",
      "“you call it guessing. i call it knowing, my friend.”\n",
      "“in cranchester?” i hazarded.\n",
      "“no,” replied poirot gravely, “not in cranchester.”\n",
      "he said no more, but at a gesture from him the assembled party took\n",
      "their seats. as they did so, the door opened once more and two other\n",
      "people came in and sat down near the door. they were parker and the\n",
      "housekeeper.\n",
      "“the number is complete,” said poirot. “every one is here.”\n",
      "there was a ring of satisfaction in his tone. and with the sound of it\n",
      "i saw a ripple of something like uneasiness pass over all those faces\n",
      "grouped at the other end of the room. there was a suggestion in all\n",
      "this as of a trap—a trap that had closed.\n",
      "poirot read from a list in an important manner.\n",
      "“mrs. ackroyd, miss flora ackroyd, major blunt, mr. geoffrey raymond,\n",
      "mrs. ralph paton, john parker, elizabeth russell.”\n",
      "he laid the paper down on the table.\n",
      "“what’s the meaning of all this?” began raymond.\n",
      "“the list i have just read,” said poirot, “is a list of suspected\n",
      "persons. every one of you present had the opportunity to kill mr.\n",
      "ackroyd——”\n",
      "with a cry mrs. ackroyd sprang up, her throat working.\n",
      "“i don’t like it,” she wailed. “i don’t like it. i would much prefer to\n",
      "go home.”\n",
      "“you cannot go home, madame,” said poirot sternly, “until you have\n",
      "heard what i have to say.”\n",
      "he paused a moment, then cleared his throat.\n",
      "“i will start at the beginning. when miss ackroyd asked me to\n",
      "investigate the case, i went up to fernly park with the good dr.\n",
      "sheppard. i walked with him along the terrace, where i was shown the\n",
      "footprints on the window-sill. from there inspector raglan took me\n",
      "along the path which leads to the drive. my eye was caught by a little\n",
      "summer-house, and i searched it thoroughly. i found two things—a scrap\n",
      "of starched cambric and an empty goose quill. the scrap of cambric\n",
      "immediately suggested to me a maid’s apron. when inspector raglan\n",
      "showed me his list of the people in the house, i noticed at once that\n",
      "one of the maids—ursula bourne, the parlormaid—had no real alibi.\n",
      "according to her own story, she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty\n",
      "until ten. but supposing that instead she was in the summer-house?\n",
      "if so, she must have gone there to meet some one. now we know from\n",
      "dr. sheppard that some one from outside _did_ come to the house that\n",
      "night—the stranger whom he met just by the gate. at a first glance it\n",
      "would seem that our problem was solved, and that the stranger went to\n",
      "the summer-house to meet ursula bourne. it was fairly certain that he\n",
      "_did_ go to the summer-house because of the goose quill. that suggested\n",
      "at once to my mind a taker of drugs—and one who had acquired the habit\n",
      "on the other side of the atlantic where sniffing ‘snow’ is more common\n",
      "than in this country. the man whom dr. sheppard met had an american\n",
      "accent, which fitted in with that supposition.\n",
      "“but i was held up by one point. _the times did not fit._ ursula\n",
      "bourne could certainly not have gone to the summer-house before\n",
      "nine-thirty, whereas the man must have got there by a few minutes\n",
      "past nine. i could, of course, assume that he waited there for half\n",
      "an hour. the only alternative supposition was that there had been two\n",
      "separate meetings in the summer-house that night. _eh bien_, as soon\n",
      "as i went into that alternative i found several significant facts. i\n",
      "discovered that miss russell, the housekeeper, had visited dr. sheppard\n",
      "that morning, and had displayed a good deal of interest in cures for\n",
      "victims of the drug habit. taking that in conjunction with the goose\n",
      "quill, i assumed that the man in question came to fernly to meet the\n",
      "housekeeper, and not ursula bourne. who, then, did ursula bourne come\n",
      "to the rendezvous to meet? i was not long in doubt. first i found a\n",
      "ring—a wedding ring—with ‘from r.’ and a date inside it. then i learnt\n",
      "that ralph paton had been seen coming up the path which led to the\n",
      "summer-house at twenty-five minutes past nine, and i also heard of\n",
      "a certain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the\n",
      "village that very afternoon—a conversation between ralph paton and\n",
      "some unknown girl. so i had my facts succeeding each other in a neat\n",
      "and orderly manner. a secret marriage, an engagement announced on the\n",
      "day of the tragedy, the stormy interview in the wood, and the meeting\n",
      "arranged for the summer-house that night.\n",
      "“incidentally this proved to me one thing, that both ralph paton and\n",
      "ursula bourne (or paton) had the strongest motives for wishing mr.\n",
      "ackroyd out of the way. and it also made one other point unexpectedly\n",
      "clear. it could not have been ralph paton who was with mr. ackroyd in\n",
      "the study at nine-thirty.\n",
      "“so we come to another and most interesting aspect of the crime. who\n",
      "was it in the room with mr. ackroyd at nine-thirty? not ralph paton,\n",
      "who was in the summer-house with his wife. not charles kent, who\n",
      "had already left. who, then? i posed my cleverest—my most audacious\n",
      "question: _was any one with him?_”\n",
      "poirot leaned forward and shot the last words triumphantly at us,\n",
      "drawing back afterwards with the air of one who has made a decided hit.\n",
      "raymond, however, did not seem impressed, and lodged a mild protest.\n",
      "“i don’t know if you’re trying to make me out a liar, m. poirot, but\n",
      "the matter does not rest on my evidence alone—except perhaps as to the\n",
      "exact words used. remember, major blunt also heard mr. ackroyd talking\n",
      "to some one. he was on the terrace outside, and couldn’t catch the\n",
      "words clearly, but he distinctly heard the voices.”\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“i have not forgotten,” he said quietly. “but major blunt was under the\n",
      "impression that it was _you_ to whom mr. ackroyd was speaking.”\n",
      "for a moment raymond seemed taken aback. then he recovered himself.\n",
      "“blunt knows now that he was mistaken,” he said.\n",
      "“exactly,” agreed the other man.\n",
      "“yet there must have been some reason for his thinking so,” mused\n",
      "poirot. “oh! no,” he held up his hand in protest, “i know the reason\n",
      "you will give—but it is not enough. we must seek elsewhere. i will put\n",
      "it this way. from the beginning of the case i have been struck by one\n",
      "thing—the nature of those words which mr. raymond overheard. it has\n",
      "been amazing to me that no one has commented on them—has seen anything\n",
      "odd about them.”\n",
      "he paused a minute, and then quoted softly:—\n",
      "“... _the calls on my purse have been so frequent of late that i fear\n",
      "it is impossible for me to accede to your request._ does nothing strike\n",
      "you as odd about that?”\n",
      "“i don’t think so,” said raymond. “he has frequently dictated letters\n",
      "to me, using almost exactly those same words.”\n",
      "“exactly,” cried poirot. “that is what i seek to arrive at. would any\n",
      "man use such a phrase in _talking_ to another? impossible that that\n",
      "should be part of a real conversation. now, if he had been dictating a\n",
      "letter——”\n",
      "“you mean he was reading a letter aloud,” said raymond slowly. “even\n",
      "so, he must have been reading to some one.”\n",
      "“but why? we have no evidence that there was any one else in the room.\n",
      "no other voice but mr. ackroyd’s was heard, remember.”\n",
      "“surely a man wouldn’t read letters of that type aloud to himself—not\n",
      "unless he was—well—going balmy.”\n",
      "“you have all forgotten one thing,” said poirot softly: “the stranger\n",
      "who called at the house the preceding wednesday.”\n",
      "they all stared at him.\n",
      "“but yes,” said poirot, nodding encouragingly, “on wednesday. the\n",
      "young man was not of himself important. but the firm he represented\n",
      "interested me very much.”\n",
      "“the dictaphone company,” gasped raymond. “i see it now. a dictaphone.\n",
      "that’s what you think?”\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“mr. ackroyd had promised to invest in a dictaphone, you remember.\n",
      "me, i had the curiosity to inquire of the company in question. their\n",
      "reply is that mr. ackroyd _did_ purchase a dictaphone from their\n",
      "representative. why he concealed the matter from you, i do not know.”\n",
      "“he must have meant to surprise me with it,” murmured raymond. “he had\n",
      "quite a childish love of surprising people. meant to keep it up his\n",
      "sleeve for a day or so. probably was playing with it like a new toy.\n",
      "yes, it fits in. you’re quite right—no one would use quite those words\n",
      "in casual conversation.”\n",
      "“it explains, too,” said poirot, “why major blunt thought it was you\n",
      "who were in the study. such scraps as came to him were fragments of\n",
      "dictation, and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him.\n",
      "his conscious mind was occupied with something quite different—the\n",
      "white figure he had caught a glimpse of. he fancied it was miss\n",
      "ackroyd. really, of course, it was ursula bourne’s white apron he saw\n",
      "as she was stealing down to the summer-house.”\n",
      "raymond had recovered from his first surprise.\n",
      "“all the same,” he remarked, “this discovery of yours, brilliant though\n",
      "it is (i’m quite sure i should never have thought of it), leaves the\n",
      "essential position unchanged. mr. ackroyd was alive at nine-thirty,\n",
      "since he was speaking into the dictaphone. it seems clear that the man\n",
      "charles kent was really off the premises by then. as to ralph paton——?”\n",
      "he hesitated, glancing at ursula.\n",
      "her color flared up, but she answered steadily enough.\n",
      "“ralph and i parted just before a quarter to ten. he never went near\n",
      "the house, i am sure of that. he had no intention of doing so. the last\n",
      "thing on earth he wanted was to face his stepfather. he would have\n",
      "funked it badly.”\n",
      "“it isn’t that i doubt your story for a moment,” explained raymond.\n",
      "“i’ve always been quite sure captain paton was innocent. but one has to\n",
      "think of a court of law—and the questions that would be asked. he is in\n",
      "a most unfortunate position, but if he were to come forward——”\n",
      "poirot interrupted.\n",
      "“that is your advice, yes? that he should come forward?”\n",
      "“certainly. if you know where he is——”\n",
      "“i perceive that you do not believe that i do know. and yet i have told\n",
      "you just now that i know everything. the truth of the telephone call,\n",
      "of the footprints on the window-sill, of the hiding-place of ralph\n",
      "paton——”\n",
      "“where is he?” said blunt sharply.\n",
      "“not very far away,” said poirot, smiling.\n",
      "“in cranchester?” i asked.\n",
      "poirot turned towards me.\n",
      "“always you ask me that. the idea of cranchester it is with you an\n",
      "_idée fixe_. no, he is not in cranchester. he is—_there_!”\n",
      "he pointed a dramatic forefinger. every one’s head turned.\n",
      "ralph paton was standing in the doorway.\n",
      " chapter xxiv\n",
      " ralph paton’s story\n",
      "it was a very uncomfortable minute for _me_. i hardly took in what\n",
      "happened next, but there were exclamations and cries of surprise! when\n",
      "i was sufficiently master of myself to be able to realize what was\n",
      "going on, ralph paton was standing by his wife, her hand in his, and he\n",
      "was smiling across the room at me.\n",
      "poirot, too, was smiling, and at the same time shaking an eloquent\n",
      "finger at me.\n",
      "“have i not told you at least thirty-six times that it is useless to\n",
      "conceal things from hercule poirot?” he demanded. “that in such a case\n",
      "he finds out?”\n",
      "he turned to the others.\n",
      "“one day, you remember, we held a little séance about a table—just\n",
      "the six of us. i accused the other five persons present of concealing\n",
      "something from me. four of them gave up their secret. dr. sheppard did\n",
      "not give up his. but all along i have had my suspicions. dr. sheppard\n",
      "went to the three boars that night hoping to find ralph. he did not\n",
      "find him there; but supposing, i said to myself, that he met him in the\n",
      "street on his way home? dr. sheppard was a friend of captain paton’s,\n",
      "and he had come straight from the scene of the crime. he must know that\n",
      "things looked very black against him. perhaps he knew more than the\n",
      "general public did——”\n",
      "“i did,” i said ruefully. “i suppose i might as well make a clean\n",
      "breast of things now. i went to see ralph that afternoon. at first he\n",
      "refused to take me into his confidence, but later he told me about his\n",
      "marriage, and the hole he was in. as soon as the murder was discovered,\n",
      "i realized that once the facts were known, suspicion could not fail to\n",
      "attach to ralph—or, if not to him, to the girl he loved. that night i\n",
      "put the facts plainly before him. the thought of having possibly to\n",
      "give evidence which might incriminate his wife made him resolve at all\n",
      "costs to—to——”\n",
      "i hesitated, and ralph filled up the gap.\n",
      "“to do a bunk,” he said graphically. “you see, ursula left me to go\n",
      "back to the house. i thought it possible that she might have attempted\n",
      "to have another interview with my stepfather. he had already been very\n",
      "rude to her that afternoon. it occurred to me that he might have so\n",
      "insulted her—in such an unforgivable manner—that without knowing what\n",
      "she was doing——”\n",
      "he stopped. ursula released her hand from his, and stepped back.\n",
      "“you thought that, ralph! you actually thought that i might have done\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "“let us get back to the culpable conduct of dr. sheppard,” said poirot\n",
      "dryly. “dr. sheppard consented to do what he could to help him. he was\n",
      "successful in hiding captain paton from the police.”\n",
      "“where?” asked raymond. “in his own house?”\n",
      "“ah, no, indeed,” said poirot. “you should ask yourself the question\n",
      "that i did. if the good doctor is concealing the young man, what place\n",
      "would he choose? it must necessarily be somewhere near at hand. i think\n",
      "of cranchester. a hotel? no. lodgings? even more emphatically, no.\n",
      "where, then? ah! i have it. a nursing home. a home for the mentally\n",
      "unfit. i test my theory. i invent a nephew with mental trouble. i\n",
      "consult mademoiselle sheppard as to suitable homes. she gives me the\n",
      "names of two near cranchester to which her brother has sent patients. i\n",
      "make inquiries. yes, at one of them a patient was brought there by the\n",
      "doctor himself early on saturday morning. that patient, though known\n",
      "by another name, i had no difficulty in identifying as captain paton.\n",
      "after certain necessary formalities, i was allowed to bring him away.\n",
      "he arrived at my house in the early hours of yesterday morning.”\n",
      "i looked at him ruefully.\n",
      "“caroline’s home office expert,” i murmured. “and to think i never\n",
      "guessed!”\n",
      "“you see now why i drew attention to the reticence of your manuscript,”\n",
      "murmured poirot. “it was strictly truthful as far as it went—but it did\n",
      "not go very far, eh, my friend?”\n",
      "i was too abashed to argue.\n",
      "“dr. sheppard has been very loyal,” said ralph. “he has stood by me\n",
      "through thick and thin. he did what he thought was the best. i see now,\n",
      "from what m. poirot has told me, that it was not really the best. i\n",
      "should have come forward and faced the music. you see, in the home, we\n",
      "never saw a newspaper. i knew nothing of what was going on.”\n",
      "“dr. sheppard has been a model of discretion,” said poirot dryly. “but\n",
      "me, i discover all the little secrets. it is my business.”\n",
      "“now we can have your story of what happened that night,” said raymond\n",
      "impatiently.\n",
      "“you know it already,” said ralph. “there’s very little for me to add.\n",
      "i left the summer-house about nine-forty-five, and tramped about the\n",

      "on it with the toe of my boot.\n",
      "i was puzzled. for the first time i was absolutely at sea as to\n",
      "poirot’s meaning. for a moment i was inclined to think that the scene\n",
      "i had just witnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast—that he had been\n",
      "what he called “playing the comedy” with a view to making himself\n",
      "interesting and important. but, in spite of myself, i was forced to\n",
      "believe in an underlying reality. there had been real menace in his\n",
      "words—a certain indisputable sincerity. but i still believed him to be\n",
      "on entirely the wrong tack.\n",

      "the guilty person this elaborate warning?”\n",

      "smoked for a minute or two in silence. then:—\n",
      "“use your little gray cells,” he said. “there is always a reason behind\n",
      "my actions.”\n",
      "i hesitated for a moment, and then i said slowly:\n",
      "“the first one that occurs to me is that you yourself do not know who\n",
      "the guilty person is, but that you are sure that he is to be found\n",
      "amongst the people here to-night. therefore your words were intended to\n",
      "force a confession from the unknown murderer?”\n",
      "poirot nodded approvingly.\n",
      "“a clever idea, but not the truth.”\n",
      "“i thought, perhaps, that by making him believe you knew, you might\n",
      "force him out into the open—not necessarily by confession. he might try\n",
      "to silence you as he formerly silenced mr. ackroyd—before you could act\n",
      "to-morrow morning.”\n",
      "“a trap with myself as the bait! _merci, mon ami_, but i am not\n",
      "sufficiently heroic for that.”\n",
      "“then i fail to understand you. surely you are running the risk of\n",
      "letting the murderer escape by thus putting him on his guard?”\n",
      "poirot shook his head.\n",
      "“he cannot escape,” he said gravely. “there is only one way out—and\n",
      "that way does not lead to freedom.”\n",
      "“you really believe that one of those people here to-night committed\n",
      "the murder?” i asked incredulously.\n",
      "“yes, my friend.”\n",
      "“which one?”\n",
      "there was a silence for some minutes. then poirot tossed the stump of\n",

      "you shall accompany me, and see for yourself that all the facts point\n",
      "indisputably to one person. now, to begin with, there were two facts\n",
      "and one little discrepancy in time which especially attracted my\n",
      "attention. the first fact was the telephone call. if ralph paton were\n",
      "indeed the murderer, the telephone call became meaningless and absurd.\n",
      "therefore, i said to myself, ralph paton is not the murderer.\n",
      "“i satisfied myself that the call could not have been sent by any one\n",
      "in the house, yet i was convinced that it was amongst those present\n",
      "on the fatal evening that i had to look for my criminal. therefore i\n",
      "concluded that the telephone call must have been sent by an accomplice.\n",
      "i was not quite pleased with that deduction, but i let it stand for the\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "“i next examined the _motive_ for the call. that was difficult. i could\n",
      "only get at it by judging its _result_. which was—that the murder was\n",
      "discovered that night instead of—in all probability—the following\n",
      "morning. you agree with that?”\n",
      "“ye-es,” i admitted. “yes. as you say, mr. ackroyd, having given orders\n",
      "that he was not to be disturbed, nobody would have been likely to go to\n",
      "the study that night.”\n",
      "“_très bien._ the affair marches, does it not? but matters were\n",
      "still obscure. what was the advantage of having the crime discovered\n",
      "that night in preference to the following morning? the only idea i\n",
      "could get hold of was that the murderer, knowing the crime was to be\n",
      "discovered at a certain time, could make sure of being present when the\n",
      "door was broken in—or at any rate immediately afterwards. and now we\n",
      "come to the second fact—the chair pulled out from the wall. inspector\n",
      "raglan dismissed that as of no importance. i, on the contrary, have\n",
      "always regarded it as of supreme importance.\n",
      "“in your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study.\n",
      "if you had it with you this minute you would see that—the chair being\n",
      "drawn out in the position indicated by parker—it would stand in a\n",
      "direct line between the door and the window.”\n",
      "“the window!” i said quickly.\n",
      "“you, too, have my first idea. i imagined that the chair was drawn out\n",
      "so that something connected with the window should not be seen by any\n",
      "one entering through the door. but i soon abandoned that supposition,\n",
      "for though the chair was a grandfather with a high back, it obscured\n",
      "very little of the window—only the part between the sash and the\n",
      "ground. no, _mon ami_—but remember that just in front of the window\n",
      "there stood a table with books and magazines upon it. now that table\n",
      "_was_ completely hidden by the drawn-out chair—and immediately i had my\n",
      "first shadowy suspicion of the truth.\n",
      "“supposing that there had been something on that table not intended\n",
      "to be seen? something placed there by the murderer? as yet i had no\n",
      "inkling of what that something might be. but i knew certain very\n",
      "interesting facts about it. for instance, it was something that the\n",
      "murderer had not been able to take away with him at the time that he\n",
      "committed the crime. at the same time it was vital that it should be\n",

      "“now four people were on the scene before the police arrived. yourself,\n",
      "parker, major blunt, and mr. raymond. parker i eliminated at once,\n",
      "since at whatever time the crime was discovered, he was the one\n",
      "person certain to be on the spot. also it was he who told me of the\n",
      "pulled-out chair. parker, then, was cleared (of the murder, that is. i\n",
      "still thought it possible that he had been blackmailing mrs. ferrars).\n",
      "raymond and blunt, however, remained under suspicion since, if the\n",
      "crime had been discovered in the early hours of the morning, it was\n",
      "quite possible that they might have arrived on the scene too late to\n",
      "prevent the object on the round table being discovered.\n",
      "“now what was that object? you heard my arguments to-night in reference\n",

      "seems to have escaped them. granted that a dictaphone was being used by\n",
      "mr. ackroyd that night—why was no dictaphone found?”\n",
      "“i never thought of that,” i said.\n",
      "“we know that a dictaphone was supplied to mr. ackroyd. but no\n",
      "dictaphone has been found amongst his effects. so, if something was\n",
      "taken from that table—why should not that something be the dictaphone?\n",
      "but there were certain difficulties in the way. the attention of every\n",
      "one was, of course, focused on the murdered man. i think any one could\n",
      "have gone to the table unnoticed by the other people in the room. but\n",
      "a dictaphone has a certain bulk—it cannot be slipped casually into\n",

      "holding it.\n",
      "“you see where i am arriving? the figure of the murderer is taking\n",
      "shape. a person who was on the scene straightway, but who might not\n",

      "fitted——”\n",
      "i interrupted.\n",
      "“but why remove the dictaphone? what was the point?”\n",
      "“you are like mr. raymond. you take it for granted that what was heard\n",
      "at nine-thirty was mr. ackroyd’s voice speaking into a dictaphone. but\n",
      "consider this useful invention for a little minute. you dictate into\n",
      "it, do you not? and at some later time a secretary or a typist turns it\n",
      "on, and the voice speaks again.”\n",
      "“you mean——” i gasped.\n",
      "poirot nodded.\n",
      "“yes, i mean that. _at nine-thirty mr. ackroyd was already dead._ it\n",
      "was the dictaphone speaking—not the man.”\n",
      "“and the murderer switched it on. then he must have been in the room at\n",

      "“possibly. but we must not exclude the likelihood of some mechanical\n",

      "or even of a simple alarm clock. but in that case we must add two\n",
      "qualifications to our imaginary portrait of the murderer. it must be\n",
      "some one who knew of mr. ackroyd’s purchase of the dictaphone and also\n",
      "some one with the necessary mechanical knowledge.\n",
      "“i had got thus far in my own mind when we came to the footprints on\n",
      "the window ledge. here there were three conclusions open to me. (1)\n",
      "they might really have been made by ralph paton. he had been at fernly\n",
      "that night, and might have climbed into the study and found his uncle\n",
      "dead there. that was one hypothesis. (2) there was the possibility that\n",
      "the footmarks might have been made by somebody else who happened to\n",
      "have the same kind of studs in his shoes. but the inmates of the house\n",
      "had shoes soled with crepe rubber, and i declined to believe in the\n",
      "coincidence of some one from outside having the same kind of shoes as\n",
      "ralph paton wore. charles kent, as we know from the barmaid of the dog\n",
      "and whistle, had on a pair of boots ‘clean dropping off him.’ (3) those\n",
      "prints were made by some one deliberately trying to throw suspicion\n",
      "on ralph paton. to test this last conclusion, it was necessary to\n",
      "ascertain certain facts. one pair of ralph’s shoes had been obtained\n",
      "from the three boars by the police. neither ralph nor any one else\n",
      "could have worn them that evening, since they were downstairs being\n",
      "cleaned. according to the police theory, ralph was wearing another pair\n",
      "of the same kind, and i found out that it was true that he had two\n",
      "pairs. now for my theory to be proved correct it was necessary for the\n",
      "murderer to have worn ralph’s shoes that evening—in which case ralph\n",
      "must have been wearing yet a _third_ pair of footwear of some kind.\n",
      "i could hardly suppose that he would bring three pairs of shoes all\n",
      "alike—the third pair of footwear were more likely to be boots. i got\n",
      "your sister to make inquiries on this point—laying some stress on the\n",
      "color, in order—i admit it frankly—to obscure the real reason for my\n",
      "asking.\n",
      "“you know the result of her investigations. ralph paton _had_ had a\n",
      "pair of boots with him. the first question i asked him when he came to\n",
      "my house yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the\n",
      "fatal night. he replied at once that he had worn _boots_—he was still\n",

      "might argue that any one in the house might have done so, but i will\n",

      "“discrepancy in time?” i queried, puzzled.\n",
      "“but yes. you will remember that every one agreed—you yourself\n",
