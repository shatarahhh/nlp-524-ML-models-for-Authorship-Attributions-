Chapter 1,"i danger {1}
being the log of captain john sirius
it is an amazing thing that the english who have the reputation of being
a practical nation never saw the danger to which they were exposed for
many years they had been spending nearly a hundred millions a year upon
their army and their fleet squadrons of dreadnoughts costing two
millions each had been launched they had spent enormous sums upon
cruisers and both their torpedo and their submarine squadrons were
exceptionally strong they were also by no means weak in their aerial
power especially in the matter of seaplanes besides all this their
army was very efficient in spite of its limited numbers and it was the
most expensive in europe yet when the day of trial came all this
imposing force was of no use whatever and might as well have not
existed their ruin could not have been more complete or more rapid if
they had not possessed an ironclad or a regiment and all this was
accomplished by me captain john sirius belonging to the navy of one of
the smallest powers in europe and having under my command a flotilla of
eight vessels the collective cost of which was eighteen hundred thousand
pounds no one has a better right to tell the story than i i will not trouble you about the dispute concerning the colonial
frontier embittered as it was by the subsequent death of the two
missionaries a naval officer has nothing to do with politics i only
came upon the scene after the ultimatum had been actually received admiral horli had been summoned to the presence and he asked that i
should be allowed to accompany him because he happened to know that i
had some clear ideas as to the weak points of england and also some
schemes as to how to take advantage of them there were only four of us
present at this meeting--the king the foreign secretary admiral horli and myself the time allowed by the ultimatum expired in forty-eight
hours i am not breaking any confidence when i say that both the king and the
minister were in favour of a surrender they saw no possibility of
standing up against the colossal power of great britain the minister
had drawn up an acceptance of the british terms and the king sat with it
before him on the table i saw the tears of anger and humiliation run
down his cheeks as he looked at it ""i fear that there is no possible alternative sire "" said the minister ""our envoy in london has just sent this report which shows that the
public and the press are more united than he has ever known them the
feeling is intense especially since the rash act of malort in
desecrating the flag we must give way ""
the king looked sadly at admiral horli ""what is your effective fleet admiral "" he asked ""two battleships four cruisers twenty torpedo-boats and eight
submarines "" said the admiral the king shook his head ""it would be madness to resist "" said he ""and yet sire "" said the admiral ""before you come to a decision i
should wish you to hear captain sirius who has a very definite plan of
campaign against the english ""
""absurd "" said the king impatiently ""what is the use do you imagine
that you could defeat their vast armada ""
""sire "" i answered ""i will stake my life that if you will follow my
advice you will within a month or six weeks at the utmost bring proud
england to her knees ""
there was an assurance in my voice which arrested the attention of the
king ""you seem self-confident captain sirius ""
""i have no doubt at all sire ""
""what then would you advise ""
""i would advise sire that the whole fleet be gathered under the forts
of blankenberg and be protected from attack by booms and piles there
they can stay till the war is over the eight submarines however you
will leave in my charge to use as i think fit ""
""ah you would attack the english battleships with submarines ""
""sire i would never go near an english battleship ""
""and why not ""
""because they might injure me sire ""
""what a sailor and afraid ""
""my life belongs to the country sire it is nothing but these eight
ships--everything depends upon them i could not risk them nothing
would induce me to fight ""
""then what will you do ""
""i will tell you sire "" and i did so for half an hour i spoke i was
clear and strong and definite for many an hour on a lonely watch i had
spent in thinking out every detail i held them enthralled the king
never took his eyes from my face the minister sat as if turned to
stone ""are you sure of all this ""
""perfectly sire ""
the king rose from the table ""send no answer to the ultimatum "" said he ""announce in both houses
that we stand firm in the face of menace admiral horli you will in all
respects carry out that which captain sirius may demand in furtherance of
his plan captain sirius the field is clear go forth and do as you
have said a grateful king will know how to reward you ""
i need not trouble you by telling you the measures which were taken at
blankenberg since as you are aware the fortress and the entire fleet
were destroyed by the british within a week of the declaration of war i
will confine myself to my own plans which had so glorious and final a
result the fame of my eight submarines _alpha_ _beta_ _gamma_ _theta_ _delta_ _epsilon_ _iota_ and _kappa_ have spread through the world to
such an extent that people have begun to think that there was something
peculiar in their form and capabilities this is not so four of them the _delta_ _epsilon_ _iota_ and _kappa_ were it is true of the
very latest model but had their equals (though not their superiors) in
the navies of all the great powers as to _alpha_ _beta_ _gamma_ and
_theta_ they were by no means modern vessels and found their prototypes
in the old f class of british boats having a submerged displacement of
eight hundred tons with heavy oil engines of sixteen hundred
horse-power giving them a speed of eighteen knots on the surface and of
twelve knots submerged their length was one hundred and eighty-six and
their breadth twenty-four feet they had a radius of action of four
thousand miles and a submerged endurance of nine hours these were
considered the latest word in 1915 but the four new boats exceeded them
in all respects without troubling you with precise figures i may say
that they represented roughly a twenty-five per cent advance up on the
older boats and were fitted with several auxiliary engines which were
wanting in the others at my suggestion instead of carrying eight of
the very large bakdorf torpedoes which are nineteen feet long weigh
half a ton and are charged with two hundred pounds of wet gun-cotton we
had tubes designed for eighteen of less than half the size it was my
design to make myself independent of my base and yet it was clear that i must have a base so i made arrangements at
once with that object blankenberg was the last place i would have
chosen why should i have a _port_ of any kind ports would be watched
or occupied any place would do for me i finally chose a small villa
standing alone nearly five miles from any village and thirty miles from
any port to this i ordered them to convey secretly by night oil spare parts extra torpedoes storage batteries reserve periscopes and
everything that i could need for refitting the little whitewashed villa
of a retired confectioner--that was the base from which i operated
against england the boats lay at blankenberg and thither i went they were working
frantically at the defences and they had only to look seawards to be
spurred to fresh exertions the british fleet was assembling the
ultimatum had not yet expired but it was evident that a blow would be
struck the instant that it did four of their aeroplanes circling at an
immense height were surveying our defences from the top of the
lighthouse i counted thirty battleships and cruisers in the offing with
a number of the trawlers with which in the british service they break
through the mine-fields the approaches were actually sown with two
hundred mines half contact and half observation but the result showed
that they were insufficient to hold off the enemy since three days later
both town and fleet were speedily destroyed however i am not here to tell you the incidents of the war but to
explain my own part in it which had such a decisive effect upon the
result my first action was to send my four second-class boats away
instantly to the point which i had chosen for my base there they were
to wait submerged lying with negative buoyancy upon the sands in twenty
foot of water and rising only at night my strict orders were that they
were to attempt nothing upon the enemy however tempting the opportunity all they had to do was to remain intact and unseen until they received
further orders having made this clear to commander panza who had
charge of this reserve flotilla i shook him by the hand and bade him
farewell leaving with him a sheet of notepaper upon which i had
explained the tactics to be used and given him certain general principles
which he could apply as circumstances demanded my whole attention was now given to my own flotilla which i divided into
two divisions keeping _iota_ and _kappa_ under my own command while
captain miriam had _delta_ and _epsilon_ he was to operate separately
in the british channel while my station was the straits of dover i
made the whole plan of campaign clear to him then i saw that each ship
was provided with all it could carry each had forty tons of heavy oil
for surface propulsion and charging the dynamo which supplied the
electric engines under water each had also eighteen torpedoes as
explained and five hundred rounds for the collapsible quick-firing twelve-
pounder which we carried on deck and which of course disappeared into
a water-tight tank when we were submerged we carried spare periscopes
and a wireless mast which could be elevated above the conning-tower when
necessary there were provisions for sixteen days for the ten men who
manned each craft such was the equipment of the four boats which were
destined to bring to naught all the navies and armies of britain at
sundown that day--it was april 10th--we set forth upon our historic
voyage miriam had got away in the afternoon since he had so much farther to go
to reach his station stephan of the _kappa_ started with me; but of
course we realized that we must work independently and that from that
moment when we shut the sliding hatches of our conning-towers on the
still waters of blankenberg harbour it was unlikely that we should ever
see each other again though consorts in the same waters i waved to
stephan from the side of my conning-tower and he to me then i called
through the tube to my engineer (our water-tanks were already filled and
all kingstons and vents closed) to put her full speed ahead just as we came abreast of the end of the pier and saw the white-capped
waves rolling in upon us i put the horizontal rudder hard down and she
slid under water through my glass portholes i saw its light green
change to a dark blue while the manometer in front of me indicated
twenty feet i let her go to forty because i should then be under the
warships of the english though i took the chance of fouling the moorings
of our own floating contact mines then i brought her on an even keel and it was music to my ear to hear the gentle even ticking of my
electric engines and to know that i was speeding at twelve miles an hour
on my great task at that moment as i stood controlling my levers in my tower i could
have seen had my cupola been of glass the vast shadows of the british
blockaders hovering above me i held my course due westward for ninety
minutes and then by shutting off the electric engine without blowing
out the water-tanks i brought her to the surface there was a rolling
sea and the wind was freshening so i did not think it safe to keep my
hatch open long for so small is the margin of buoyancy that one must run
no risks but from the crests of the rollers i had a look backwards at
blankenberg and saw the black funnels and upper works of the enemy's
fleet with the lighthouse and the castle behind them all flushed with
the pink glow of the setting sun even as i looked there was the boom of
a great gun and then another i glanced at my watch it was six
o'clock the time of the ultimatum had expired we were at war there was no craft near us and our surface speed is nearly twice that of
our submerged so i blew out the tanks and our whale-back came over the
surface all night we were steering south-west making an average of
eighteen knots at about five in the morning as i stood alone upon my
tiny bridge i saw low down in the west the scattered lights of the
norfolk coast ""ah johnny johnny bull "" i said as i looked at them ""you are going to have your lesson and i am to be your master it is i
who have been chosen to teach you that one cannot live under artificial
conditions and yet act as if they were natural ones more foresight johnny and less party politics--that is my lesson to you "" and then i
had a wave of pity too when i thought of those vast droves of helpless
people yorkshire miners lancashire spinners birmingham metal-workers the dockers and workers of london over whose little homes i would bring
the shadow of starvation i seemed to see all those wasted eager hands
held out for food and i john sirius dashing it aside ah well war
is war and if one is foolish one must pay the price just before daybreak i saw the lights of a considerable town which must
have been yarmouth bearing about ten miles west-south-west on our
starboard bow i took her farther out for it is a sandy dangerous
coast with many shoals at five-thirty we were abreast of the lowestoft
lightship a coastguard was sending up flash signals which faded into a
pale twinkle as the white dawn crept over the water there was a good
deal of shipping about mostly fishing-boats and small coasting craft with one large steamer hull-down to the west and a torpedo destroyer
between us and the land it could not harm us and yet i thought it as
well that there should be no word of our presence so i filled my tanks
again and went down to ten feet i was pleased to find that we got under
in one hundred and fifty seconds the life of one's boat may depend on
this when a swift craft comes suddenly upon you we were now within a few hours of our cruising ground so i determined to
snatch a rest leaving vornal in charge when he woke me at ten o'clock
we were running on the surface and had reached the essex coast off the
maplin sands with that charming frankness which is one of their
characteristics our friends of england had informed us by their press
that they had put a cordon of torpedo-boats across the straits of dover
to prevent the passage of submarines which is about as sensible as to
lay a wooden plank across a stream to keep the eels from passing i knew
that stephan whose station lay at the western end of the solent would
have no difficulty in reaching it my own cruising ground was to be at
the mouth of the thames and here i was at the very spot with my tiny
_iota_ my eighteen torpedoes my quick-firing gun and above all a
brain that knew what should be done and how to do it when i resumed my place in the conning-tower i saw in the periscope (for
we had dived) that a lightship was within a few hundred yards of us upon
the port bow two men were sitting on her bulwarks but neither of them
cast an eye upon the little rod that clove the water so close to them it
was an ideal day for submarine action with enough ripple upon the
surface to make us difficult to detect and yet smooth enough to give me
a clear view each of my three periscopes had an angle of sixty degrees
so that between them i commanded a complete semi-circle of the horizon two british cruisers were steaming north from the thames within half a
mile of me i could easily have cut them off and attacked them had i
allowed myself to be diverted from my great plan farther south a
destroyer was passing westwards to sheerness a dozen small steamers
were moving about none of these were worthy of my notice great
countries are not provisioned by small steamers i kept the engines
running at the lowest pace which would hold our position under water and moving slowly across the estuary i waited for what must assuredly
come i had not long to wait shortly after one o'clock i perceived in the
periscope a cloud of smoke to the south half an hour later a large
steamer raised her hull making for the mouth of the thames i ordered
vornal to stand by the starboard torpedo-tube having the other also
loaded in case of a miss then i advanced slowly for though the steamer
was going very swiftly we could easily cut her off presently i laid the
_iota_ in a position near which she must pass and would very gladly have
lain to but could not for fear of rising to the surface i therefore
steered out in the direction from which she was coming she was a very
large ship fifteen thousand tons at the least painted black above and
red below with two cream-coloured funnels she lay so low in the water
that it was clear she had a full cargo at her bows were a cluster of
men some of them looking i dare say for the first time at the mother
country how little could they have guessed the welcome that was
awaiting them on she came with the great plumes of smoke floating from her funnels and
two white waves foaming from her cut-water she was within a quarter of
a mile my moment had arrived i signalled full speed ahead and steered
straight for her course my timing was exact at a hundred yards i gave
the signal and heard the clank and swish of the discharge at the same
instant i put the helm hard down and flew off at an angle there was a
terrific lurch which came from the distant explosion for a moment we
were almost upon our side then after staggering and trembling the
_iota_ came on an even keel i stopped the engines brought her to the
surface and opened the conning-tower while all my excited crew came
crowding to the hatch to know what had happened the ship lay within two hundred yards of us and it was easy to see that
she had her death-blow she was already settling down by the stern there was a sound of shouting and people were running wildly about her
decks her name was visible the _adela_ of london bound as we
afterwards learned from new zealand with frozen mutton strange as it
may seem to you the notion of a submarine had never even now occurred to
her people and all were convinced that they had struck a floating mine the starboard quarter had been blown in by the explosion and the ship
was sinking rapidly their discipline was admirable we saw boat after
boat slip down crowded with people as swiftly and quietly as if it were
part of their daily drill and suddenly as one of the boats lay off
waiting for the others they caught a glimpse for the first time of my
conning-tower so close to them i saw them shouting and pointing while
the men in the other boats got up to have a better look at us for my
part i cared nothing for i took it for granted that they already knew
that a submarine had destroyed them one of them clambered back into the
sinking ship i was sure that he was about to send a wireless message as
to our presence it mattered nothing since in any case it must be
known; otherwise i could easily have brought him down with a rifle as
it was i waved my hand to them and they waved back to me war is too
big a thing to leave room for personal ill-feeling but it must be
remorseless all the same i was still looking at the sinking _adela_ when vornal who was beside
me gave a sudden cry of warning and surprise gripping me by the
shoulder and turning my head there behind us coming up the fairway was a huge black vessel with black funnels flying the well-known house-
flag of the p and o company she was not a mile distant and i
calculated in an instant that even if she had seen us she would not have
time to turn and get away before we could reach her we went straight
for her therefore keeping awash just as we were they saw the sinking
vessel in front of them and that little dark speck moving over the
surface and they suddenly understood their danger i saw a number of
men rush to the bows and there was a rattle of rifle-fire two bullets
were flattened upon our four-inch armour you might as well try to stop
a charging bull with paper pellets as the _iota_ with rifle-fire i had
learned my lesson from the _adela_ and this time i had the torpedo
discharged at a safer distance--two hundred and fifty yards we caught
her amidships and the explosion was tremendous but we were well outside
its area she sank almost instantaneously i am sorry for her people of whom i hear that more than two hundred including seventy lascars and
forty passengers were drowned yes i am sorry for them but when i
think of the huge floating granary that went to the bottom i rejoice as
a man does who has carried out that which he plans it was a bad afternoon that for the p and o company the second ship
which we destroyed was as we have since learned the _moldavia_ of
fifteen thousand tons one of their finest vessels; but about half-past
three we blew up the _cusco_ of eight thousand of the same line also
from eastern ports and laden with corn why she came on in face of the
wireless messages which must have warned her of danger i cannot imagine the other two steamers which we blew up that day the _maid of athens_
(robson line) and the _cormorant_ were neither of them provided with
apparatus and came blindly to their destruction both were small boats
of from five thousand to seven thousand tons in the case of the second i had to rise to the surface and fire six twelve-pound shells under her
water-line before she would sink in each case the crew took to the
boats and so far as i know no casualties occurred after that no more steamers came along nor did i expect them warnings
must by this time have been flying in all directions but we had no
reason to be dissatisfied with our first day between the maplin sands
and the nore we had sunk five ships of a total tonnage of about fifty
thousand tons already the london markets would begin to feel the pinch and lloyd's--poor old lloyd's--what a demented state it would be in i
could imagine the london evening papers and the howling in fleet street we saw the result of our actions for it was quite laughable to see the
torpedo-boats buzzing like angry wasps out of sheerness in the evening they were darting in every direction across the estuary and the
aeroplanes and hydroplanes were like flights of crows black dots against
the red western sky they quartered the whole river mouth until they
discovered us at last some sharp-sighted fellow with a telescope on
board of a destroyer got a sight of our periscope and came for us full
speed no doubt he would very gladly have rammed us even if it had
meant his own destruction but that was not part of our programme at all i sank her and ran her east-south-east with an occasional rise finally
we brought her to not very far from the kentish coast and the search-
lights of our pursuers were far on the western skyline there we lay
quietly all night for a submarine at night is nothing more than a very
third-rate surface torpedo-boat besides we were all weary and needed
rest do not forget you captains of men when you grease and trim your
pumps and compressors and rotators that the human machine needs some
tending also i had put up the wireless mast above the conning-tower and had no
difficulty in calling up captain stephan he was lying he said off
ventnor and had been unable to reach his station on account of engine
trouble which he had now set right next morning he proposed to block
the southampton approach he had destroyed one large indian boat on his
way down channel we exchanged good wishes like myself he needed
rest i was up at four in the morning however and called all hands to
overhaul the boat she was somewhat up by the head owing to the forward
torpedoes having been used so we trimmed her by opening the forward
compensating tank admitting as much water as the torpedoes had weighed we also overhauled the starboard air-compressor and one of the periscope
motors which had been jarred by the shock of the first explosion we had
hardly got ourselves shipshape when the morning dawned i have no doubt that a good many ships which had taken refuge in the
french ports at the first alarm had run across and got safely up the
river in the night of course i could have attacked them but i do not
care to take risks--and there are always risks for a submarine at night but one had miscalculated his time and there she was just abreast of
warden point when the daylight disclosed her to us in an instant we
were after her it was a near thing for she was a flier and could do
two miles to our one; but we just reached her as she went swashing by she saw us at the last moment for i attacked her awash since otherwise
we could not have had the pace to reach her she swung away and the
first torpedo missed but the second took her full under the counter heavens what a smash the whole stern seemed to go aloft i drew off
and watched her sink she went down in seven minutes leaving her masts
and funnels over the water and a cluster of her people holding on to
them she was the _virginia_ of the bibby line--twelve thousand
tons--and laden like the others with foodstuffs from the east the
whole surface of the sea was covered with the floating grain ""john bull
will have to take up a hole or two of his belt if this goes on "" said
vornal as we watched the scene and it was at that moment that the very worst danger occurred that could
befall us i tremble now when i think how our glorious voyage might have
been nipped in the bud i had freed the hatch of my tower and was
looking at the boats of the _virginia_ with vornal near me when there
was a swish and a terrific splash in the water beside us which covered
us both with spray we looked up and you can imagine our feelings when
we saw an aeroplane hovering a few hundred feet above us like a hawk with its silencer it was perfectly noiseless and had its bomb not
fallen into the sea we should never have known what had destroyed us she
was circling round in the hope of dropping a second one but we shoved on
all speed ahead crammed down the rudders and vanished into the side of
a roller i kept the deflection indicator falling until i had put fifty
good feet of water between the aeroplane and ourselves for i knew well
how deeply they can see under the surface however we soon threw her
off our track and when we came to the surface near margate there was no
sign of her unless she was one of several which we saw hovering over
herne bay there was not a ship in the offing save a few small coasters and little
thousand-ton steamers which were beneath my notice for several hours i
lay submerged with a blank periscope then i had an inspiration orders
had been marconied to every foodship to lie in french waters and dash
across after dark i was as sure of it as if they had been recorded in
our own receiver well if they were there that was where i should be
also i blew out the tanks and rose for there was no sign of any
warship near they had some good system of signalling from the shore however for i had not got to the north foreland before three destroyers
came foaming after me all converging from different directions they
had about as good a chance of catching me as three spaniels would have of
overtaking a porpoise out of pure bravado--i know it was very wrong--i
waited until they were actually within gunshot then i sank and we saw
each other no more it is as i have said a shallow sandy coast and submarine navigation is
very difficult the worst mishap that can befall a boat is to bury its
nose in the side of a sand-drift and be held there such an accident
might have been the end of our boat though with our fleuss cylinders and
electric lamps we should have found no difficulty in getting out at the
air-lock and in walking ashore across the bed of the ocean as it was however i was able thanks to our excellent charts to keep the channel
and so to gain the open straits there we rose about midday but observing a hydroplane at no great distance we sank again for half an
hour when we came up for the second time all was peaceful around us and the english coast was lining the whole western horizon we kept
outside the goodwins and straight down channel until we saw a line of
black dots in front of us which i knew to be the dover-calais torpedo-
boat cordon when two miles distant we dived and came up again seven
miles to the south-west without one of them dreaming that we had been
within thirty feet of their keels when we rose a large steamer flying the german flag was within half a
mile of us it was the north german lloyd _altona_ from new york to
bremen i raised our whole hull and dipped our flag to her it was
amusing to see the amazement of her people at what they must have
regarded as our unparalleled impudence in those english-swept waters they cheered us heartily and the tricolour flag was dipped in greeting
as they went roaring past us then i stood in to the french coast it was exactly as i had expected there were three great british
steamers lying at anchor in boulogne outer harbour they were the
_caesar_ the _king of the east_ and the _pathfinder_ none less than
ten thousand tons i suppose they thought they were safe in french
waters but what did i care about three-mile limits and international
law the view of my government was that england was blockaded food
contraband and vessels carrying it to be destroyed the lawyers could
argue about it afterwards my business was to starve the enemy any way i
could within an hour the three ships were under the waves and the
_iota_ was streaming down the picardy coast looking for fresh victims the channel was covered with english torpedo-boats buzzing and whirling
like a cloud of midges how they thought they could hurt me i cannot
imagine unless by accident i were to come up underneath one of them more dangerous were the aeroplanes which circled here and there the water being calm i had several times to descend as deep as a hundred
feet before i was sure that i was out of their sight after i had blown
up the three ships at boulogne i saw two aeroplanes flying down channel and i knew that they would head off any vessels which were coming up there was one very large white steamer lying off havre but she steamed
west before i could reach her i dare say stephan or one of the others
would get her before long but those infernal aeroplanes spoiled our
sport for that day not another steamer did i see save the never-ending
torpedo-boats i consoled myself with the reflection however that no
food was passing me on its way to london that was what i was there for after all if i could do it without spending my torpedoes all the
better up to date i had fired ten of them and sunk nine steamers so i
had not wasted my weapons that night i came back to the kent coast and
lay upon the bottom in shallow water near dungeness we were all trimmed and ready at the first break of day for i expected
to catch some ships which had tried to make the thames in the darkness
and had miscalculated their time sure enough there was a great steamer
coming up channel and flying the american flag it was all the same to
me what flag she flew so long as she was engaged in conveying contraband
of war to the british isles there were no torpedo-boats about at the
moment so i ran out on the surface and fired a shot across her bows she
seemed inclined to go on so i put a second one just above her water-line
on her port bow she stopped then and a very angry man began to
gesticulate from the bridge i ran the _iota_ almost alongside ""are you the captain "" i asked ""what the--"" i won't attempt to reproduce his language ""you have food-stuffs on board "" i said ""it's an american ship you blind beetle "" he cried ""can't you see the
flag it's the _vermondia_ of boston ""
""sorry captain "" i answered ""i have really no time for words those
shots of mine will bring the torpedo-boats and i dare say at this very
moment your wireless is making trouble for me get your people into the
boats ""
i had to show him i was not bluffing so i drew off and began putting
shells into him just on the water-line when i had knocked six holes in
it he was very busy on his boats i fired twenty shots altogether and
no torpedo was needed for she was lying over with a terrible list to
port and presently came right on to her side there she lay for two or
three minutes before she foundered there were eight boats crammed with
people lying round her when she went down i believe everybody was
saved but i could not wait to inquire from all quarters the poor old
panting useless war-vessels were hurrying i filled my tanks ran her
bows under and came up fifteen miles to the south of course i knew
there would be a big row afterwards--as there was--but that did not help
the starving crowds round the london bakers who only saved their skins poor devils by explaining to the mob that they had nothing to bake by this time i was becoming rather anxious as you can imagine to know
what was going on in the world and what england was thinking about it
all i ran alongside a fishing-boat therefore and ordered them to give
up their papers unfortunately they had none except a rag of an evening
paper which was full of nothing but betting news in a second attempt i
came alongside a small yachting party from eastbourne who were
frightened to death at our sudden appearance out of the depths from
them we were lucky enough to get the london _courier_ of that very
morning it was interesting reading--so interesting that i had to announce it all
to the crew of course you know the british style of headline which
gives you all the news at a glance it seemed to me that the whole paper
was headlines it was in such a state of excitement hardly a word about
me and my flotilla we were on the second page the first one began
something like this:--
 capture of blankenberg * * * * *
 destruction of enemy's fleet
 * * * * *
 burning of town
 * * * * *
 trawlers destroy mine field
 loss of two battleships
 * * * * *
 is it the end of course what i had foreseen had occurred the town was actually
occupied by the british and they thought it was the end we would see
about that on the round-the-corner page at the back of the glorious resonant
leaders there was a little column which read like this:--
 hostile submarines
 several of the enemy's submarines are at sea and have inflicted some
 appreciable damage upon our merchant ships the danger-spots upon
 monday and the greater part of tuesday appear to have been the mouth
 of the thames and the western entrance to the solent on monday between the nore and margate there were sunk five large steamers the
 _adela_ _moldavia_ _cusco_ _cormorant_ and _maid of athens_ particulars of which will be found below near ventnor on the same
 day was sunk the _verulam_ from bombay on tuesday the _virginia_ _caesar_ _king of the east_ and _pathfinder_ were destroyed between
 the foreland and boulogne the latter three were actually lying in
 french waters and the most energetic representations have been made
 by the government of the republic on the same day _the queen of
 sheba_ _orontes_ _diana_ and _atalanta_ were destroyed near the
 needles wireless messages have stopped all ingoing cargo-ships from
 coming up channel but unfortunately there is evidence that at least
 two of the enemy's submarines are in the west four cattle-ships from
 dublin to liverpool were sunk yesterday evening while three bristol-
 bound steamers _the hilda_ _mercury_ and _maria toser_ were blown
 up in the neighbourhood of lundy island commerce has so far as
 possible been diverted into safer channels but in the meantime however vexatious these incidents may be and however grievous the
 loss both to the owners and to lloyd's we may console ourselves by
 the reflection that since a submarine cannot keep the sea for more
 than ten days without refitting and since the base has been captured there must come a speedy term to these depredations ""
so much for the _courier's_ account of our proceedings another small
paragraph was however more eloquent:--
 ""the price of wheat which stood at thirty-five shillings a week
 before the declaration of war was quoted yesterday on the baltic at
 fifty-two maize has gone from twenty-one to thirty-seven barley
 from nineteen to thirty-five sugar (foreign granulated) from eleven
 shillings and threepence to nineteen shillings and sixpence ""
""good my lads "" said i when i read it to the crew ""i can assure you
that those few lines will prove to mean more than the whole page about
the fall of blankenberg now let us get down channel and send those
prices up a little higher ""
all traffic had stopped for london--not so bad for the little _iota_--and
we did not see a steamer that was worth a torpedo between dungeness and
the isle of wight there i called stephan up by wireless and by seven
o'clock we were actually lying side by side in a smooth rolling
sea--hengistbury head bearing n n w and about five miles distant the
two crews clustered on the whale-backs and shouted their joy at seeing
friendly faces once more stephan had done extraordinarily well i had of course read in the london paper of his four ships on tuesday but he
had sunk no fewer than seven since for many of those which should have
come to the thames had tried to make southampton of the seven one was
of twenty thousand tons a grain-ship from america a second was a grain-
ship from the black sea and two others were great liners from south
africa i congratulated stephan with all my heart upon his splendid
achievement then as we had been seen by a destroyer which was
approaching at a great pace we both dived coming up again off the
needles where we spent the night in company we could not visit each
other since we had no boat but we lay so nearly alongside that we were
able stephan and i to talk from hatch to hatch and so make our plans he had shot away more than half his torpedoes and so had i and yet we
were very averse from returning to our base so long as our oil held out i told him of my experience with the boston steamer and we mutually
agreed to sink the ships by gun-fire in future so far as possible i
remember old horli saying ""what use is a gun aboard a submarine "" we
were about to show i read the english paper to stephan by the light of
my electric torch and we both agreed that few ships would now come up
the channel that sentence about diverting commerce to safer routes
could only mean that the ships would go round the north of ireland and
unload at glasgow oh for two more ships to stop that entrance heavens what _would_ england have done against a foe with thirty or
forty submarines since we only needed six instead of four to complete
her destruction after much talk we decided that the best plan would be
that i should dispatch a cipher telegram next morning from a french port
to tell them to send the four second-rate boats to cruise off the north
of ireland and west of scotland then when i had done this i should move
down channel with stephan and operate at the mouth while the other two
boats could work in the irish sea having made these plans i set off
across the channel in the early morning reaching the small village of
etretat in brittany there i got off my telegram and then laid my
course for falmouth passing under the keels of two british cruisers
which were making eagerly for etretat having heard by wireless that we
were there half-way down channel we had trouble with a short circuit in our electric
engines and were compelled to run on the surface for several hours while
we replaced one of the cam-shafts and renewed some washers it was a
ticklish time for had a torpedo-boat come upon us we could not have
dived the perfect submarine of the future will surely have some
alternative engines for such an emergency however by the skill of
engineer morro we got things going once more all the time we lay there
i saw a hydroplane floating between us and the british coast i can
understand how a mouse feels when it is in a tuft of grass and sees a
hawk high up in the heavens however all went well; the mouse became a
water-rat it wagged its tail in derision at the poor blind old hawk and
it dived down into a nice safe green quiet world where there was nothing
to injure it it was on the wednesday night that the _iota_ crossed to etretat it was
friday afternoon before we had reached our new cruising ground only one
large steamer did i see upon our way the terror we had caused had
cleared the channel this big boat had a clever captain on board his
tactics were excellent and took him in safety to the thames he came
zigzagging up channel at twenty-five knots shooting off from his course
at all sorts of unexpected angles with our slow pace we could not catch
him nor could we calculate his line so as to cut him off of course he
had never seen us but he judged and judged rightly that wherever we
were those were the tactics by which he had the best chance of getting
past he deserved his success but of course it is only in a wide channel that such things can be
done had i met him in the mouth of the thames there would have been a
different story to tell as i approached falmouth i destroyed a three-
thousand-ton boat from cork laden with butter and cheese it was my
only success for three days that night (friday april 16th) i called up stephan but received no
reply as i was within a few miles of our rendezvous and as he would
not be cruising after dark i was puzzled to account for his silence i
could only imagine that his wireless was deranged but alas i was soon to find the true reason from a copy of the _western morning
news_ which i obtained from a brixham trawler the _kappa_ with her
gallant commander and crew were at the bottom of the english channel it appeared from this account that after i had parted from him he had met
and sunk no fewer than five vessels i gathered these to be his work since all of them were by gun-fire and all were on the south coast of
dorset or devon how he met his fate was stated in a short telegram
which was headed ""sinking of a hostile submarine "" it was marked
""falmouth "" and ran thus:--
 the p and o mail steamer _macedonia_ came into this port last night
 with five shell holes between wind and water she reports having been
 attacked by a hostile submarine ten miles to the south-east of the
 lizard instead of using her torpedoes the submarine for some reason
 approached from the surface and fired five shots from a semi-automatic
 twelve-pounder gun she was evidently under the impression that the
 _macedonia_ was unarmed as a matter of fact being warned of the
 presence of submarines in the channel the _macedonia_ had mounted her
 armament as an auxiliary cruiser she opened fire with two
 quick-firers and blew away the conning-tower of the submarine it is
 probable that the shells went right through her as she sank at once
 with her hatches open the _macedonia_ was only kept afloat by her
 pumps such was the end of the _kappa_ and my gallant friend commander
stephan his best epitaph was in a corner of the same paper and was
headed ""mark lane "" it ran:--
 ""wheat (average) 66 maize 48 barley 50 ""
well if stephan was gone there was the more need for me to show energy my plans were quickly taken but they were comprehensive all that day
(saturday) i passed down the cornish coast and round land's end getting
two steamers on the way i had learned from stephan's fate that it was
better to torpedo the large craft but i was aware that the auxiliary
cruisers of the british government were all over ten thousand tons so
that for all ships under that size it was safe to use my gun both these
craft the _yelland_ and the _playboy_--the latter an american ship--were
perfectly harmless so i came up within a hundred yards of them and
speedily sank them after allowing their people to get into boats some
other steamers lay farther out but i was so eager to make my new
arrangements that i did not go out of my course to molest them just
before sunset however so magnificent a prey came within my radius of
action that i could not possibly refuse her no sailor could fail to
recognize that glorious monarch of the sea with her four cream funnels
tipped with black her huge black sides her red bilges and her high
white top-hamper roaring up channel at twenty-three knots and carrying
her forty-five thousand tons as lightly as if she were a five-ton motor-
boat it was the queenly _olympic_ of the white star--once the largest
and still the comeliest of liners what a picture she made with the
blue cornish sea creaming round her giant fore-foot and the pink western
sky with one evening star forming the background to her noble lines she was about five miles off when we dived to cut her off my
calculation was exact as we came abreast we loosed our torpedo and
struck her fair we swirled round with the concussion of the water i
saw her in my periscope list over on her side and i knew that she had
her death-blow she settled down slowly and there was plenty of time to
save her people the sea was dotted with her boats when i got about
three miles off i rose to the surface and the whole crew clustered up to
see the wonderful sight she dived bows foremost and there was a
terrific explosion which sent one of the funnels into the air i
suppose we should have cheered--somehow none of us felt like cheering we were all keen sailors and it went to our hearts to see such a ship go
down like a broken eggshell i gave a gruff order and all were at their
posts again while we headed north-west once round the land's end i
called up my two consorts and we met next day at hartland point the
south end of bideford bay for the moment the channel was clear but the
english could not know it and i reckoned that the loss of the _olympic_
would stop all ships for a day or two at least having assembled the _delta_ and _epsilon_ one on each side of me i
received the report from miriam and var the respective commanders each
had expended twelve torpedoes and between them they had sunk twenty-two
steamers one man had been killed by the machinery on board of the
_delta_ and two had been burned by the ignition of some oil on the
_epsilon_ i took these injured men on board and i gave each of the
boats one of my crew i also divided my spare oil my provisions and my
torpedoes among them though we had the greatest possible difficulty in
those crank vessels in transferring them from one to the other however by ten o'clock it was done and the two vessels were in condition to keep
the sea for another ten days for my part with only two torpedoes left i headed north up the irish sea one of my torpedoes i expended that
evening upon a cattle-ship making for milford haven late at night being abreast of holyhead i called upon my four northern boats but
without reply their marconi range is very limited about three in the
afternoon of the next day i had a feeble answer it was a great relief
to me to find that my telegraphic instructions had reached them and that
they were on their station before evening we all assembled in the lee
of sanda island in the mull of kintyre i felt an admiral indeed when i
saw my five whale-backs all in a row panza's report was excellent they
had come round by the pentland firth and reached their cruising ground on
the fourth day already they had destroyed twenty vessels without any
mishap i ordered the _beta_ to divide her oil and torpedoes among the
other three so that they were in good condition to continue their
cruise then the _beta_ and i headed for home reaching our base upon
sunday april 25th off cape wrath i picked up a paper from a small
schooner ""wheat 84; maize 60; barley 62 "" what were battles and bombardments
compared to that the whole coast of norland was closely blockaded by cordon within cordon and every port even the smallest held by the british but why should
they suspect my modest confectioner's villa more than any other of the
ten thousand houses that face the sea i was glad when i picked up its
homely white front in my periscope that night i landed and found my
stores intact before morning the _beta_ reported itself for we had the
windows lit as a guide it is not for me to recount the messages which i found waiting for me at
my humble headquarters they shall ever remain as the patents of
nobility of my family among others was that never-to-be-forgotten
salutation from my king he desired me to present myself at hauptville but for once i took it upon myself to disobey his commands it took me
two days--or rather two nights for we sank ourselves during the daylight
hours--to get all our stores on board but my presence was needful every
minute of the time on the third morning at four o'clock the _beta_
and my own little flagship were at sea once more bound for our original
station off the mouth of the thames i had no time to read our papers whilst i was refitting but i gathered
the news after we got under way the british occupied all our ports but
otherwise we had not suffered at all since we have excellent railway
communications with europe prices had altered little and our
industries continued as before there was talk of a british invasion but this i knew to be absolute nonsense for the british must have
learned by this time that it would be sheer murder to send transports
full of soldiers to sea in the face of submarines when they have a
tunnel they can use their fine expeditionary force upon the continent but until then it might just as well not exist so far as europe is
concerned my own country therefore was in good case and had nothing
to fear great britain however was already feeling my grip upon her
throat as in normal times four-fifths of her food is imported prices
were rising by leaps and bounds the supplies in the country were
beginning to show signs of depletion while little was coming in to
replace it the insurances at lloyd's had risen to a figure which made
the price of the food prohibitive to the mass of the people by the time
it had reached the market the loaf which under ordinary circumstances
stood at fivepence was already at one and twopence beef was three
shillings and fourpence a pound and mutton two shillings and ninepence everything else was in proportion the government had acted with energy
and offered a big bounty for corn to be planted at once it could only
be reaped five months hence however and long before then as the papers
pointed out half the island would be dead from starvation strong
appeals had been made to the patriotism of the people and they were
assured that the interference with trade was temporary and that with a
little patience all would be well but already there was a marked rise
in the death-rate especially among children who suffered from want of
milk the cattle being slaughtered for food there was serious rioting
in the lanarkshire coalfields and in the midlands together with a
socialistic upheaval in the east of london which had assumed the
proportions of a civil war already there were responsible papers which
declared that england was in an impossible position and that an
immediate peace was necessary to prevent one of the greatest tragedies in
history it was my task now to prove to them that they were right it was may 2nd when i found myself back at the maplin sands to the north
of the estuary of the thames the _beta_ was sent on to the solent to
block it and take the place of the lamented _kappa_ and now i was
throttling britain indeed--london southampton the bristol channel liverpool the north channel the glasgow approaches each was guarded by
my boats great liners were as we learned afterwards pouring their
supplies into galway and the west of ireland where provisions were
cheaper than has ever been known tens of thousands were embarking from
britain for ireland in order to save themselves from starvation but you
cannot transplant a whole dense population the main body of the people by the middle of may were actually starving at that date wheat was at
a hundred maize and barley at eighty even the most obstinate had begun
to see that the situation could not possibly continue in the great towns starving crowds clamoured for bread before the
municipal offices and public officials everywhere were attacked and
often murdered by frantic mobs composed largely of desperate women who
had seen their infants perish before their eyes in the country roots bark and weeds of every sort were used as food in london the private
mansions of ministers were guarded by strong pickets of soldiers while a
battalion of guards was camped permanently round the houses of
parliament the lives of the prime minister and of the foreign secretary
were continually threatened and occasionally attempted yet the
government had entered upon the war with the full assent of every party
in the state the true culprits were those be they politicians or
journalists who had not the foresight to understand that unless britain
grew her own supplies or unless by means of a tunnel she had some way of
conveying them into the island all her mighty expenditure upon her army
and her fleet was a mere waste of money so long as her antagonists had a
few submarines and men who could use them england has often been
stupid but has got off scot-free this time she was stupid and had to
pay the price you can't expect luck to be your saviour always it would be a mere repetition of what i have already described if i were
to recount all our proceedings during that first ten days after i resumed
my station during my absence the ships had taken heart and had begun to
come up again in the first day i got four after that i had to go
farther afield and again i picked up several in french waters once i
had a narrow escape through one of my kingston valves getting some grit
into it and refusing to act when i was below the surface our margin of
buoyancy just carried us through by the end of that week the channel
was clear again and both _beta_ and my own boat were down west once
more there we had encouraging messages from our bristol consort who in
turn had heard from _delta_ at liverpool our task was completely done we could not prevent all food from passing into the british islands but
at least we had raised what did get in to a price which put it far beyond
the means of the penniless workless multitudes in vain government
commandeered it all and doled it out as a general feeds the garrison of a
fortress the task was too great--the responsibility too horrible even
the proud and stubborn english could not face it any longer i remember well how the news came to me i was lying at the time off
selsey bill when i saw a small war-vessel coming down channel it had
never been my policy to attack any vessel coming _down_ my torpedoes
and even my shells were too precious for that i could not help being
attracted however by the movements of this ship which came slowly
zigzagging in my direction ""looking for me "" thought i ""what on earth does the foolish thing hope
to do if she could find me ""
i was lying awash at the time and got ready to go below in case she
should come for me but at that moment--she was about half a mile
away--she turned her quarter and there to my amazement was the red flag
with the blue circle our own beloved flag flying from her peak for a
moment i thought that this was some clever dodge of the enemy to tempt me
within range i snatched up my glasses and called on vornal then we
both recognized the vessel it was the _juno_ the only one left intact
of our own cruisers what could she be doing flying the flag in the
enemy's waters then i understood it and turning to vornal we threw
ourselves into each other's arms it could only mean an armistice--or
peace and it was peace we learned the glad news when we had risen alongside
the _juno_ and the ringing cheers which greeted us had at last died
away our orders were to report ourselves at once at blankenberg then
she passed on down channel to collect the others we returned to port
upon the surface steaming through the whole british fleet as we passed
up the north sea the crews clustered thick along the sides of the
vessels to watch us i can see now their sullen angry faces many
shook their fists and cursed us as we went by it was not that we had
damaged them--i will do them the justice to say that the english as the
old boer war has proved bear no resentment against a brave enemy--but
that they thought us cowardly to attack merchant ships and avoid the
warships it is like the arabs who think that a flank attack is a mean unmanly device war is not a big game my english friends it is a
desperate business to gain the upper hand and one must use one's brain
in order to find the weak spot of one's enemy it is not fair to blame
me if i have found yours it was my duty perhaps those officers and
sailors who scowled at the little _iota_ that may morning have by this
time done me justice when the first bitterness of undeserved defeat was
passed let others describe my entrance into blankenberg; the mad enthusiasm of
the crowds and the magnificent public reception of each successive boat
as it arrived surely the men deserved the grant made them by the state
which has enabled each of them to be independent for life as a feat of
endurance that long residence in such a state of mental tension in
cramped quarters breathing an unnatural atmosphere will long remain as
a record the country may well be proud of such sailors the terms of peace were not made onerous for we were in no condition to
make great britain our permanent enemy we knew well that we had won the
war by circumstances which would never be allowed to occur again and
that in a few years the island power would be as strong as ever--stronger perhaps--for the lesson that she had learned it would be madness to
provoke such an antagonist a mutual salute of flags was arranged the
colonial boundary was adjusted by arbitration and we claimed no
indemnity beyond an undertaking on the part of britain that she would pay
any damages which an international court might award to france or to the
united states for injury received through the operations of our
submarines so ended the war of course england will not be caught napping in such a fashion again her foolish blindness is partly explained by her delusion that her enemy
would not torpedo merchant vessels common sense should have told her
that her enemy will play the game that suits them best--that they will
not inquire what they may do but they will do it first and talk about it
afterwards the opinion of the whole world now is that if a blockade
were proclaimed one may do what one can with those who try to break it and that it was as reasonable to prevent food from reaching england in
war time as it is for a besieger to prevent the victualling of a
beleaguered fortress i cannot end this account better than by quoting the first few paragraphs
of a leader in the _times_ which appeared shortly after the declaration
of peace it may be taken to epitomize the saner public opinion of
england upon the meaning and lessons of the episode ""in all this miserable business "" said the writer ""which has cost us
 the loss of a considerable portion of our merchant fleet and more than
 fifty thousand civilian lives there is just one consolation to be
 found it lies in the fact that our temporary conqueror is a power
 which is not strong enough to reap the fruits of her victory had we
 endured this humiliation at the hands of any of the first-class powers
 it would certainly have entailed the loss of all our crown colonies
 and tropical possessions besides the payment of a huge indemnity we
 were absolutely at the feet of our conqueror and had no possible
 alternative but to submit to her terms however onerous norland has
 had the good sense to understand that she must not abuse her temporary
 advantage and has been generous in her dealings in the grip of any
 other power we should have ceased to exist as an empire ""even now we are not out of the wood some one may maliciously pick a
 quarrel with us before we get our house in order and use the easy
 weapon which has been demonstrated it is to meet such a contingency
 that the government has rushed enormous stores of food at the public
 expense into the country in a very few months the new harvest will
 have appeared on the whole we can face the immediate future without
 undue depression though there remain some causes for anxiety these
 will no doubt be energetically handled by this new and efficient
 government which has taken the place of those discredited politicians
 who led us into a war without having foreseen how helpless we were
 against an obvious form of attack ""already the lines of our reconstruction are evident the first and
 most important is that our party men realize that there is something
 more vital than their academic disputes about free trade or
 protection and that all theory must give way to the fact that a
 country is in an artificial and dangerous condition if she does not
 produce within her own borders sufficient food to at least keep life
 in her population whether this should be brought about by a tax upon
 foreign foodstuffs or by a bounty upon home products or by a
 combination of the two is now under discussion but all parties are
 combined upon the principle and though it will undoubtedly entail
 either a rise in prices or a deterioration in quality in the food of
 the working-classes they will at least be insured against so terrible
 a visitation as that which is fresh in our memories at any rate we
 have got past the stage of argument it _must_ be so the increased
 prosperity of the farming interest and as we will hope the
 cessation of agricultural emigration will be benefits to be counted
 against the obvious disadvantages ""the second lesson is the immediate construction of not one but two
 double-lined railways under the channel we stand in a white sheet
 over the matter since the project has always been discouraged in
 these columns but we are prepared to admit that had such railway
 communication been combined with adequate arrangements for forwarding
 supplies from marseilles we should have avoided our recent surrender we still insist that we cannot trust entirely to a tunnel since our
 enemy might have allies in the mediterranean; but in a single contest
 with any power of the north of europe it would certainly be of
 inestimable benefit there may be dangers attendant upon the
 existence of a tunnel but it must now be admitted that they are
 trivial compared to those which come from its absence as to the
 building of large fleets of merchant submarines for the carriage of
 food that is a new departure which will be an additional insurance
 against the danger which has left so dark a page in the history of our
 country """
Chapter 2,"ii one crowded hour
the place was the eastbourne-tunbridge road not very far from the cross
in hand--a lonely stretch with a heath running upon either side the
time was half-past eleven upon a sunday night in the late summer a
motor was passing slowly down the road it was a long lean rolls-royce running smoothly with a gentle purring
of the engine through the two vivid circles cast by the electric head-
lights the waving grass fringes and clumps of heather streamed swiftly
like some golden cinematograph leaving a blacker darkness behind and
around them one ruby-red spot shone upon the road but no number-plate
was visible within the dim ruddy halo of the tail-lamp which cast it the
car was open and of a tourist type but even in that obscure light for
the night was moonless an observer could hardly fail to have noticed a
curious indefiniteness in its lines as it slid into and across the
broad stream of light from an open cottage door the reason could be seen the body was hung with a singular loose arrangement of brown holland even the long black bonnet was banded with some close-drawn drapery the solitary man who drove this curious car was broad and burly he sat
hunched up over his steering-wheel with the brim of a tyrolean hat drawn
down over his eyes the red end of a cigarette smouldered under the
black shadow thrown by the headgear a dark ulster of some frieze-like
material was turned up in the collar until it covered his ears his neck
was pushed forward from his rounded shoulders and he seemed as the car
now slid noiselessly down the long sloping road with the clutch
disengaged and the engine running free to be peering ahead of him
through the darkness in search of some eagerly-expected object the distant toot of a motor-horn came faintly from some point far to the
south of him on such a night at such a place all traffic must be from
south to north when the current of london week-enders sweeps back from
the watering-place to the capital--from pleasure to duty the man sat
straight and listened intently yes there it was again and certainly
to the south of him his face was over the wheel and his eyes strained
through the darkness then suddenly he spat out his cigarette and gave a
sharp intake of the breath far away down the road two little yellow
points had rounded a curve they vanished into a dip shot upwards once
more and then vanished again the inert man in the draped car woke
suddenly into intense life from his pocket he pulled a mask of dark
cloth which he fastened securely across his face adjusting it carefully
that his sight might be unimpeded for an instant he uncovered an
acetylene hand-lantern took a hasty glance at his own preparations and
laid it beside a mauser pistol upon the seat alongside him then twitching his hat down lower than ever he released his clutch and slid
downward his gear-lever with a chuckle and shudder the long black
machine sprang forward and shot with a soft sigh from her powerful
engines down the sloping gradient the driver stooped and switched off
his electric head-lights only a dim grey swathe cut through the black
heath indicated the line of his road from in front there came presently
a confused puffing and rattling and clanging as the oncoming car breasted
the slope it coughed and spluttered on a powerful old-fashioned low
gear while its engine throbbed like a weary heart the yellow glaring
lights dipped for the last time into a switchback curve when they
reappeared over the crest the two cars were within thirty yards of each
other the dark one darted across the road and barred the other's
passage while a warning acetylene lamp was waved in the air with a
jarring of brakes the noisy new-comer was brought to a halt ""i say "" cried an aggrieved voice ""'pon my soul you know we might have
had an accident why the devil don't you keep your head-lights on i
never saw you till i nearly burst my radiators on you ""
the acetylene lamp held forward discovered a very angry young man blue-
eyed yellow-moustached and florid sitting alone at the wheel of an
antiquated twelve-horse wolseley suddenly the aggrieved look upon his
flushed face changed to one of absolute bewilderment the driver in the
dark car had sprung out of the seat a black long-barrelled wicked-looking pistol was poked in the traveller's face and behind the
further sights of it was a circle of black cloth with two deadly eyes
looking from as many slits ""hands up "" said a quick stern voice ""hands up or by the lord--""
the young man was as brave as his neighbours but the hands went up all
the same ""get down "" said his assailant curtly the young man stepped forth into the road followed closely by the
covering lantern and pistol once he made as if he would drop his hands but a short stern word jerked them up again ""i say look here this is rather out o' date ain't it "" said the
traveller ""i expect you're joking--what ""
""your watch "" said the man behind the mauser pistol ""you can't really mean it ""
""your watch i say ""
""well take it if you must it's only plated anyhow you're two
centuries out in time or a few thousand miles longitude the bush is
your mark--or america you don't seem in the picture on a sussex road ""
""purse "" said the man there was something very compelling in his voice
and methods the purse was handed over ""any rings ""
""don't wear 'em ""
""stand there don't move ""
the highwayman passed his victim and threw open the bonnet of the
wolseley his hand with a pair of steel pliers was thrust deep into
the works there was the snap of a parting wire ""hang it all don't crock my car "" cried the traveller he turned but quick as a flash the pistol was at his head once more and
yet even in that flash whilst the robber whisked round from the broken
circuit something had caught the young man's eye which made him gasp and
start he opened his mouth as if about to shout some words then with
an evident effort he restrained himself ""get in "" said the highwayman the traveller climbed back to his seat ""what is your name ""
""ronald barker what's yours ""
the masked man ignored the impertinence ""where do you live "" he asked ""my cards are in my purse take one ""
the highwayman sprang into his car the engine of which had hissed and
whispered in gentle accompaniment to the interview with a clash he
threw back his side-brake flung in his gears twirled the wheel hard
round and cleared the motionless wolseley a minute later he was
gliding swiftly with all his lights' gleaming some half-mile southward
on the road while mr ronald barker a side-lamp in his hand was
rummaging furiously among the odds and ends of his repair-box for a
strand of wire which would connect up his electricity and set him on his
way once more when he had placed a safe distance between himself and his victim the
adventurer eased up took his booty from his pocket replaced the watch opened the purse and counted out the money seven shillings constituted
the miserable spoil the poor result of his efforts seemed to amuse
rather than annoy him for he chuckled as he held the two half-crowns and
the florin in the glare of his lantern then suddenly his manner
changed he thrust the thin purse back into his pocket released his
brake and shot onwards with the same tense bearing with which he had
started upon his adventure the lights of another car were coming down
the road on this occasion the methods of the highwayman were less furtive experience had clearly given him confidence with lights still blazing he ran towards the new-comers and halting in the middle of the road summoned them to stop from the point of view of the astonished
travellers the result was sufficiently impressive they saw in the glare
of their own head-lights two glowing discs on either side of the long black-muzzled snout of a high-power car and above the masked face and
menacing figure of its solitary driver in the golden circle thrown by
the rover there stood an elegant open-topped twenty-horse humber with
an undersized and very astonished chauffeur blinking from under his
peaked cap from behind the wind-screen the veil-bound hats and
wondering faces of two very pretty young women protruded one upon either
side and a little crescendo of frightened squeaks announced the acute
emotion of one of them the other was cooler and more critical ""don't give it away hilda "" she whispered ""do shut up and don't be
such a silly it's bertie or one of the boys playing it on us ""
""no no it's the real thing flossie it's a robber sure enough oh my goodness whatever shall we do ""
""what an 'ad ' "" cried the other ""oh what a glorious 'ad ' too late
now for the mornings but they'll have it in every evening paper sure ""
""what's it going to cost "" groaned the other ""oh flossie flossie i'm
sure i'm going to faint don't you think if we both screamed together we
could do some good isn't he too awful with that black thing over his
face oh dear oh dear he's killing poor little alf ""
the proceedings of the robber were indeed somewhat alarming springing
down from his car he had pulled the chauffeur out of his seat by the
scruff of his neck the sight of the mauser had cut short all
remonstrance and under its compulsion the little man had pulled open the
bonnet and extracted the sparking plugs having thus secured the
immobility of his capture the masked man walked forward lantern in
hand to the side of the car he had laid aside the gruff sternness with
which he had treated mr ronald barker and his voice and manner were
gentle though determined he even raised his hat as a prelude to his
address ""i am sorry to inconvenience you ladies "" said he and his voice had
gone up several notes since the previous interview ""may i ask who you
are ""
miss hilda was beyond coherent speech but miss flossie was of a sterner
mould ""this is a pretty business "" said she ""what right have you to stop us
on the public road i should like to know ""
""my time is short "" said the robber in a sterner voice ""i must ask you
to answer my question ""
""tell him flossie for goodness' sake be nice to him "" cried hilda ""well we're from the gaiety theatre london if you want to know "" said
the young lady ""perhaps you've heard of miss flossie thornton and miss
hilda mannering we've been playing a week at the royal at eastbourne and took a sunday off to ourselves so now you know ""
""i must ask you for your purses and for your jewellery ""
both ladies set up shrill expostulations but they found as mr ronald
barker had done that there was something quietly compelling in this
man's methods in a very few minutes they had handed over their purses and a pile of glittering rings bangles brooches and chains was lying
upon the front seat of the car the diamonds glowed and shimmered like
little electric points in the light of the lantern he picked up the
glittering tangle and weighed it in his hand ""anything you particularly value "" he asked the ladies; but miss flossie
was in no humour for concessions ""don't come the claude duval over us "" said she ""take the lot or leave
the lot we don't want bits of our own given back to us ""
""except just billy's necklace "" cried hilda and snatched at a little
rope of pearls the robber bowed and released his hold of it ""anything else ""
the valiant flossie began suddenly to cry hilda did the same the
effect upon the robber was surprising he threw the whole heap of
jewellery into the nearest lap ""there there take it "" he said ""it's trumpery stuff anyhow it's
worth something to you and nothing to me ""
tears changed in a moment to smiles ""you're welcome to the purses the 'ad ' is worth ten times the money but what a funny way of getting a living nowadays aren't you afraid of
being caught it's all so wonderful like a scene from a comedy ""
""it may be a tragedy "" said the robber ""oh i hope not--i'm sure i hope not "" cried the two ladies of the drama but the robber was in no mood for further conversation far away down
the road tiny points of light had appeared fresh business was coming to
him and he must not mix his cases disengaging his machine he raised
his hat and slipped off to meet this new arrival while miss flossie and
miss hilda leaned out of their derelict car still palpitating from their
adventure and watched the red gleam of the tail-light until it merged
into the darkness this time there was every sign of a rich prize behind its four grand
lamps set in a broad frame of glittering brasswork the magnificent sixty-
horse daimler breasted the slope with the low deep even snore which
proclaimed its enormous latent strength like some rich-laden high-pooped spanish galleon she kept her course until the prowling craft
ahead of her swept across her bows and brought her to a sudden halt an
angry face red blotched and evil shot out of the open window of the
closed limousine the robber was aware of a high bald forehead gross
pendulous cheeks and two little crafty eyes which gleamed between
creases of fat ""out of my way sir out of my way this instant "" cried a rasping voice ""drive over him hearn get down and pull him off the seat the
fellow's drunk--he's drunk i say ""
up to this point the proceedings of the modern highwayman might have
passed as gentle now they turned in an instant to savagery the
chauffeur a burly capable fellow incited by that raucous voice behind
him sprang from the car and seized the advancing robber by the throat the latter hit out with the butt-end of his pistol and the man dropped
groaning on the road stepping over his prostrate body the adventurer
pulled open the door seized the stout occupant savagely by the ear and
dragged him bellowing on to the highway then very deliberately he
struck him twice across the face with his open hand the blows rang out
like pistol-shots in the silence of the night the fat traveller turned
a ghastly colour and fell back half senseless against the side of the
limousine the robber dragged open his coat wrenched away the heavy
gold watch-chain with all that it held plucked out the great diamond pin
that sparkled in the black satin tie dragged off four rings--not one of
which could have cost less than three figures and finally tore from his
inner pocket a bulky leather note-book all this property he transferred
to his own black overcoat and added to it the man's pearl cuff-links and even the golden stud which held his collar having made sure that
there was nothing else to take the robber flashed his lantern upon the
prostrate chauffeur and satisfied himself that he was stunned and not
dead then returning to the master he proceeded very deliberately to
tear all his clothes from his body with a ferocious energy which set his
victim whimpering and writhing in imminent expectation of murder whatever his tormentor's intention may have been it was very effectually
frustrated a sound made him turn his head and there no very great
distance off were the lights of a car coming swiftly from the north such a car must have already passed the wreckage which this pirate had
left behind him it was following his track with a deliberate purpose and might be crammed with every county constable of the district the adventurer had no time to lose he darted from his bedraggled
victim sprang into his own seat and with his foot on the accelerator
shot swiftly off down the road some way down there was a narrow side
lane and into this the fugitive turned cracking on his high speed and
leaving a good five miles between him and any pursuer before he ventured
to stop then in a quiet corner he counted over his booty of the
evening--the paltry plunder of mr ronald barker the rather
better-furnished purses of the actresses which contained four pounds
between them and finally the gorgeous jewellery and well-filled note-
book of the plutocrat upon the daimler five notes of fifty pounds four
of ten fifteen sovereigns and a number of valuable papers made up a
most noble haul it was clearly enough for one night's work the
adventurer replaced all his ill-gotten gains in his pocket and lighting
a cigarette set forth upon his way with the air of a man who has no
further care upon his mind * * * * *
it was on the monday morning following upon this eventful evening that
sir henry hailworthy of walcot old place having finished his breakfast
in a leisurely fashion strolled down to his study with the intention of
writing a few letters before setting forth to take his place upon the
county bench sir henry was a deputy-lieutenant of the county; he was a
baronet of ancient blood; he was a magistrate of ten years' standing; and
he was famous above all as the breeder of many a good horse and the most
desperate rider in all the weald country a tall upstanding man with a
strong clean-shaven face heavy black eyebrows and a square resolute
jaw he was one whom it was better to call friend than foe though
nearly fifty years of age he bore no sign of having passed his youth save that nature in one of her freakish moods had planted one little
feather of white hair above his right ear making the rest of his thick
black curls the darker by contrast he was in thoughtful mood this
morning for having lit his pipe he sat at his desk with his blank note-
paper in front of him lost in a deep reverie suddenly his thoughts were brought back to the present from behind the
laurels of the curving drive there came a low clanking sound which
swelled into the clatter and jingle of an ancient car then from round
the corner there swung an old-fashioned wolseley with a
fresh-complexioned yellow-moustached young man at the wheel sir henry
sprang to his feet at the sight and then sat down once more he rose
again as a minute later the footman announced mr ronald barker it was
an early visit but barker was sir henry's intimate friend as each was
a fine shot horseman and billiard-player there was much in common
between the two men and the younger (and poorer) was in the habit of
spending at least two evenings a week at walcot old place therefore sir henry advanced cordially with outstretched hand to welcome him ""you're an early bird this morning "" said he ""what's up if you are
going over to lewes we could motor together ""
but the younger man's demeanour was peculiar and ungracious he
disregarded the hand which was held out to him and he stood pulling at
his own long moustache and staring with troubled questioning eyes at the
county magistrate ""well what's the matter "" asked the latter still the young man did not speak he was clearly on the edge of an
interview which he found it most difficult to open his host grew
impatient ""you don't seem yourself this morning what on earth is the matter anything upset you ""
""yes "" said ronald barker with emphasis ""what has ""
""_you_ have ""
sir henry smiled ""sit down my dear fellow if you have any grievance
against me let me hear it ""
barker sat down he seemed to be gathering himself for a reproach when
it did come it was like a bullet from a gun ""why did you rob me last night ""
the magistrate was a man of iron nerve he showed neither surprise nor
resentment not a muscle twitched upon his calm set face ""why do you say that i robbed you last night ""
""a big tall fellow in a motor-car stopped me on the mayfield road he
poked a pistol in my face and took my purse and my watch sir henry that man was you ""
the magistrate smiled ""am i the only big tall man in the district am i the only man with a
motor-car ""
""do you think i couldn't tell a rolls-royce when i see it--i who spend
half my life on a car and the other half under it who has a rolls-royce
about here except you ""
""my dear barker don't you think that such a modern highwayman as you
describe would be more likely to operate outside his own district how
many hundred rolls-royces are there in the south of england ""
""no it won't do sir henry--it won't do even your voice though you
sunk it a few notes was familiar enough to me but hang it man what
did you do it _for_ that's what gets over me that you should stick up
me one of your closest friends a man that worked himself to the bone
when you stood for the division--and all for the sake of a brummagem
watch and a few shillings--is simply incredible ""
""simply incredible "" repeated the magistrate with a smile ""and then those actresses poor little devils who have to earn all they
get i followed you down the road you see that was a dirty trick if
ever i heard one the city shark was different if a chap must go a-
robbing that sort of fellow is fair game but your friend and then the
girls--well i say again i couldn't have believed it ""
""then why believe it ""
""because it _is_ so ""
""well you seem to have persuaded yourself to that effect you don't
seem to have much evidence to lay before any one else ""
""i could swear to you in a police-court what put the lid on it was that
when you were cutting my wire--and an infernal liberty it was --i saw
that white tuft of yours sticking out from behind your mask ""
for the first time an acute observer might have seen some slight sign of
emotion upon the face of the baronet ""you seem to have a fairly vivid imagination "" said he his visitor flushed with anger ""see here hailworthy "" said he opening his hand and showing a small jagged triangle of black cloth ""do you see that it was on the ground
near the car of the young women you must have ripped it off as you
jumped out from your seat now send for that heavy black driving-coat of
yours if you don't ring the bell i'll ring it myself and we shall have
it in i'm going to see this thing through and don't you make any
mistake about that ""
the baronet's answer was a surprising one he rose passed barker's
chair and walking over to the door he locked it and placed the key in
his pocket ""you _are_ going to see it through "" said he ""i'll lock you in until
you do now we must have a straight talk barker as man to man and
whether it ends in tragedy or not depends on you ""
he had half-opened one of the drawers in his desk as he spoke his
visitor frowned in anger ""you won't make matters any better by threatening me hailworthy i am
going to do my duty and you won't bluff me out of it ""
""i have no wish to bluff you when i spoke of a tragedy i did not mean
to you what i meant was that there are some turns which this affair
cannot be allowed to take i have neither kith nor kin but there is the
family honour and some things are impossible ""
""it is late to talk like that ""
""well perhaps it is; but not too late and now i have a good deal to
say to you first of all you are quite right and it was i who held you
up last night on the mayfield road ""
""but why on earth--""
""all right let me tell it my own way first i want you to look at
these "" he unlocked a drawer and he took out two small packages ""these
were to be posted in london to-night this one is addressed to you and
i may as well hand it over to you at once it contains your watch and
your purse so you see bar your cut wire you would have been none the
worse for your adventure this other packet is addressed to the young
ladies of the gaiety theatre and their properties are enclosed i hope
i have convinced you that i had intended full reparation in each case
before you came to accuse me ""
""well "" asked barker ""well we will now deal with sir george wilde who is as you may not
know the senior partner of wilde and guggendorf the founders of the
ludgate bank of infamous memory his chauffeur is a case apart you may
take it from me upon my word of honour that i had plans for the
chauffeur but it is the master that i want to speak of you know that
i am not a rich man myself i expect all the county knows that when
black tulip lost the derby i was hard hit and other things as well then i had a legacy of a thousand this infernal bank was paying 7 per
cent on deposits i knew wilde i saw him i asked him if it was
safe he said it was i paid it in and within forty-eight hours the
whole thing went to bits it came out before the official receiver that
wilde had known for three months that nothing could save him and yet he
took all my cargo aboard his sinking vessel he was all right--confound
him he had plenty besides but i had lost all my money and no law
could help me yet he had robbed me as clearly as one man could rob
another i saw him and he laughed in my face told me to stick to
consols and that the lesson was cheap at the price so i just swore
that by hook or by crook i would get level with him i knew his
habits for i had made it my business to do so i knew that he came back
from eastbourne on sunday nights i knew that he carried a good sum with
him in his pocket-book well it's _my_ pocket-book now do you mean to
tell me that i'm not morally justified in what i have done by the lord i'd have left the devil as bare as he left many a widow and orphan if
i'd had the time ""
""that's all very well but what about me what about the girls ""
""have some common sense barker do you suppose that i could go and
stick up this one personal enemy of mine and escape detection it was
impossible i was bound to make myself out to be just a common robber
who had run up against him by accident so i turned myself loose on the
high road and took my chance as the devil would have it the first man
i met was yourself i was a fool not to recognise that old ironmonger's
store of yours by the row it made coming up the hill when i saw you i
could hardly speak for laughing but i was bound to carry it through the same with the actresses i'm afraid i gave myself away for i
couldn't take their little fal-lals but i had to keep up a show then
came my man himself there was no bluff about that i was out to skin
him and i did now barker what do you think of it all i had a
pistol at your head last night and by george whether you believe it or
not you have one at mine this morning ""
the young man rose slowly and with a broad smile he wrung the magistrate
by the hand ""don't do it again it's too risky "" said he ""the swine would score
heavily if you were taken ""
""you're a good chap barker "" said the magistrate ""no i won't do it
again who's the fellow who talks of 'one crowded hour of glorious
life' by george it's too fascinating i had the time of my life talk
of fox-hunting no i'll never touch it again for it might get a grip
of me ""
a telephone rang sharply upon the table and the baronet put the receiver
to his ear as he listened he smiled across at his companion ""i'm rather late this morning "" said he ""and they are waiting for me to
try some petty larcenies on the county bench """
Chapter 3,"iii a point of view
it was an american journalist who was writing up england--or writing her
down as the mood seized him sometimes he blamed and sometimes he
praised and the case-hardened old country actually went its way all the
time quite oblivious of his approval or of his disfavour--being ready at
all times through some queer mental twist to say more bitter things and
more unjust ones about herself than any critic could ever venture upon however in the course of his many columns in the _new york clarion_ our
journalist did at last get through somebody's skin in the way that is
here narrated it was a kindly enough article upon english country-house life in which
he had described a visit paid for a week-end to sir henry trustall's there was only a single critical passage in it and it was one which he
had written with a sense both of journalistic and of democratic
satisfaction in it he had sketched off the lofty obsequiousness of the
flunkey who had ministered to his needs ""he seemed to take a smug
satisfaction in his own degradation "" said he ""surely the last spark of
manhood must have gone from the man who has so entirely lost his own
individuality he revelled in humility he was an instrument of
service--nothing more ""
some months had passed and our american pressman had recorded impressions
from st petersburg to madrid he was on his homeward way when once
again he found himself the guest of sir henry he had returned from an
afternoon's shooting and had finished dressing when there was a knock at
the door and the footman entered he was a large cleanly-built man as
is proper to a class who are chosen with a keener eye to physique than
any crack regiment the american supposed that the man had entered to
perform some menial service but to his surprise he softly closed the
door behind him ""might i have a word with you sir if you can kindly give me a moment ""
he said in the velvety voice which always got upon the visitor's
republican nerves ""well what is it "" the journalist asked sharply ""it's this sir "" the footman drew from his breast-pocket the copy of
the _clarion_ ""a friend over the water chanced to see this sir and he
thought it would be of interest to me so he sent it ""
""well ""
""you wrote it sir i fancy ""
""what if i did ""
""and this 'ere footman is your idea of me ""
the american glanced at the passage and approved his own phrases ""yes that's you "" he admitted the footman folded up his document once more and replaced it in his
pocket ""i'd like to 'ave a word or two with you over that sir "" he said in the
same suave imperturbable voice ""i don't think sir that you quite see
the thing from our point of view i'd like to put it to you as i see it
myself maybe it would strike you different then ""
the american became interested there was ""copy"" in the air ""sit down "" said he ""no sir begging your pardon sir i'd very much rather stand ""
""well do as you please if you've got anything to say get ahead with
it ""
""you see sir it's like this: there's a tradition--what you might call a
standard--among the best servants and it's 'anded down from one to the
other when i joined i was a third and my chief and the butler were
both old men who had been trained by the best i took after them just as
they took after those that went before them it goes back away further
than you can tell ""
""i can understand that ""
""but what perhaps you don't so well understand sir is the spirit that's
lying behind it there's a man's own private self-respect to which you
allude sir in this 'ere article that's his own but he can't keep
it so far as i can see unless he returns good service for the good
money that he takes ""
""well he can do that without--without--crawling ""
the footman's florid face paled a little at the word apparently he was
not quite the automatic machine that he appeared ""by your leave sir we'll come to that later "" said he ""but i want you
to understand what we are trying to do even when you don't approve of our
way of doing it we are trying to make life smooth and easy for our
master and for our master's guests we do it in the way that's been
'anded down to us as the best way if our master could suggest any
better way then it would be our place either to leave his service if we
disapproved it or else to try and do it as he wanted it would hurt the
self-respect of any good servant to take a man's money and not give him
the very best he can in return for it ""
""well "" said the american ""it's not quite as we see it in america ""
""that's right sir i was over there last year with sir henry--in new
york sir and i saw something of the men-servants and their ways they
were paid for service sir and they did not give what they were paid
for you talk about self-respect sir in this article well now my
self-respect wouldn't let me treat a master as i've seen them do over
there ""
""we don't even like the word 'master '"" said the american ""well that's neither 'ere nor there sir if i may be so bold as to say
so if you're serving a gentleman he's your master for the time being
and any name you may choose to call it by don't make no difference but
you can't eat your cake and 'ave it sir you can't sell your
independence and 'ave it too ""
""maybe not "" said the american ""all the same the fact remains that
your manhood is the worse for it ""
""there i don't 'old with you sir ""
""if it were not you wouldn't be standing there arguing so quietly you'd
speak to me in another tone i guess ""
""you must remember sir that you are my master's guest and that i am
paid to wait upon you and make your visit a pleasant one so long as you
are 'ere sir that is 'ow i regard it now in london--""
""well what about london ""
""well in london if you would have the goodness to let me have a word
with you i could make you understand a little clearer what i am trying to
explain to you 'arding is my name sir if you get a call from 'enery
'arding you'll know that i 'ave a word to say to you ""
* * * * *
so it happened about three days later that our american journalist in his
london hotel received a letter that a mr henry harding desired to speak
with him the man was waiting in the hall dressed in quiet tweeds he
had cast his manner with his uniform and was firmly deliberate in all he
said and did the professional silkiness was gone and his bearing was
all that the most democratic could desire ""it's courteous of you to see me sir "" said he ""there's that matter of
the article still open between us and i would like to have a word or two
more about it ""
""well i can give you just ten minutes "" said the american journalist ""i understand that you are a busy man sir so i'll cut it as short as i
can there's a public garden opposite if you would be so good as talk it
over in the open air ""
the pressman took his hat and accompanied the footman they walked
together down the winding gravelled path among the rhododendron bushes ""it's like this sir "" said the footman halting when they had arrived at
a quiet nook ""i was hoping that you would see it in our light and
understand me when i told you that the servant who was trying to give
honest service for his master's money and the man who is free born and
as good as his neighbour are two separate folk there's the duty man and
there's the natural man and they are different men to say that i have
no life of my own or self-respect of my own because there are days when
i give myself to the service of another is not fair treatment i was
hoping sir that when i made this clear to you you would have met me
like a man and taken it back ""
""well you have not convinced me "" said the american ""a man's a man and he's responsible for all his actions ""
""then you won't take back what you said of me--the degradation and the
rest ""
""no i don't see why i should ""
the man's comely face darkened ""you _will_ take it back "" said he ""i'll smash your blasted head if you
don't ""
the american was suddenly aware that he was in the presence of a very
ugly proposition the man was large strong and evidently most earnest
and determined his brows were knotted his eyes flashing and his fists
clenched on neutral ground he struck the journalist as really being a
very different person to the obsequious and silken footman of trustall
old manor the american had all the courage both of his race and of his
profession but he realised suddenly that he was very much in the wrong he was man enough to say so ""well sir this once "" said the footman as they shook hands ""i don't
approve of the mixin' of classes--none of the best servants do but i'm
on my own to-day so we'll let it pass but i wish you'd set it right
with your people sir i wish you would make them understand that an
english servant can give good and proper service and yet that he's a
human bein' i after all """
Chapter 4,"iv the fall of lord barrymore
these are few social historians of those days who have not told of the
long and fierce struggle between those two famous bucks sir charles
tregellis and lord barrymore for the lordship of the kingdom of st james a struggle which divided the whole of fashionable london into two
opposing camps it has been chronicled also how the peer retired
suddenly and the commoner resumed his great career without a rival only
here however one can read the real and remarkable reason for this
sudden eclipse of a star it was one morning in the days of this famous struggle that sir charles
tregellis was performing his very complicated toilet and ambrose his
valet was helping him to attain that pitch of perfection which had long
gained him the reputation of being the best-dressed man in town suddenly
sir charles paused his _coup d'archet_ half-executed the final beauty
of his neck-cloth half-achieved while he listened with surprise and
indignation upon his large comely fresh-complexioned face below the
decorous hum of jermyn street had been broken by the sharp staccato metallic beating of a doorknocker ""i begin to think that this uproar must be at our door "" said sir
charles as one who thinks aloud ""for five minutes it has come and
gone; yet perkins has his orders ""
at a gesture from his master ambrose stepped out upon the balcony and
craned his discreet head over it from the street below came a voice drawling but clear ""you would oblige me vastly fellow if you would do me the favour to
open this door "" said the voice ""who is it what is it "" asked the scandalised sir charles with his
arrested elbow still pointing upwards ambrose had returned with as much surprise upon his dark face as the
etiquette of his position would allow him to show ""it is a young gentleman sir charles ""
""a young gentleman there is no one in london who is not aware that i do
not show before midday do you know the person have you seen him
before ""
""i have not seen him sir but he is very like some one i could name ""
""like some one like whom ""
""with all respect sir charles i could for a moment have believed that
it was yourself when i looked down a smaller man sir and a youth; but
the voice the face the bearing--""
""it must be that young cub vereker my brother's ne'er-do-weel "" muttered
sir charles continuing his toilet ""i have heard that there are points
in which he resembles me he wrote from oxford that he would come and i
answered that i would not see him yet he ventures to insist the
fellow needs a lesson ambrose ring for perkins ""
a large footman entered with an outraged expression upon his face ""i cannot have this uproar at the door perkins ""
""if you please the young gentleman won't go away sir ""
""won't go away it is your duty to see that he goes away have you not
your orders didn't you tell him that i am not seen before midday ""
""i said so sir he would have pushed his way in for all i could say so i slammed the door in his face ""
""very right perkins ""
""but now sir he is making such a din that all the folk are at the
windows there is a crowd gathering in the street sir ""
from below came the crack-crack-crack of the knocker ever rising in
insistence with a chorus of laughter and encouraging comments from the
spectators sir charles flushed with anger there must be some limit to
such impertinence ""my clouded amber cane is in the corner "" said he ""take it with you perkins i give you a free hand a stripe or two may bring the young
rascal to reason ""
the large perkins smiled and departed the door was heard to open below
and the knocker was at rest a few moments later there followed a
prolonged howl and a noise as of a beaten carpet sir charles listened
with a smile which gradually faded from his good-humoured face ""the fellow must not overdo it "" he muttered ""i would not do the lad an
injury whatever his deserts may be ambrose run out on the balcony and
call him off this has gone far enough ""
but before the valet could move there came the swift patter of agile feet
upon the stairs and a handsome youth dressed in the height of fashion was standing framed in the open doorway the pose the face above all
the curious mischievous dancing light in the large blue eyes all spoke
of the famous tregellis blood even such was sir charles when twenty
years before he had by virtue of his spirit and audacity in one short
season taken a place in london from which brummell himself had afterwards
vainly struggled to depose him the youth faced the angry features of
his uncle with an air of debonair amusement and he held towards him upon his outstretched palms the broken fragments of an amber cane ""i much fear sir "" said he ""that in correcting your fellow i have had
the misfortune to injure what can only have been your property i am
vastly concerned that it should have occurred ""
sir charles stared with intolerant eyes at this impertinent apparition the other looked back in a laughable parody of his senior's manner as
ambrose had remarked after his inspection from the balcony the two were
very alike save that the younger was smaller finer cut and the more
nervously alive of the two ""you are my nephew vereker tregellis "" asked sir charles ""yours to command sir ""
""i hear bad reports of you from oxford ""
""yes sir i understand that the reports _are_ bad ""
""nothing could be worse ""
""so i have been told ""
""why are you here sir ""
""that i might see my famous uncle ""
""so you made a tumult in his street forced his door and beat his
footman ""
""yes sir ""
""you had my letter ""
""yes sir ""
""you were told that i was not receiving ""
""yes sir ""
""i can remember no such exhibition of impertinence ""
the young man smiled and rubbed his hands in satisfaction ""there is an impertinence which is redeemed by wit "" said sir charles severely ""there is another which is the mere boorishness of the
clodhopper as you grow older and wiser you may discern the difference ""
""you are very right sir "" said the young man warmly ""the finer shades
of impertinence are infinitely subtle and only experience and the
society of one who is a recognised master""--here he bowed to his
uncle--""can enable one to excel ""
sir charles was notoriously touchy in temper for the first hour after his
morning chocolate he allowed himself to show it ""i cannot congratulate my brother upon his son "" said he ""i had hoped
for something more worthy of our traditions ""
""perhaps sir upon a longer acquaintance--""
""the chance is too small to justify the very irksome experience i must
ask you sir to bring to a close a visit which never should have been
made ""
the young man smiled affably but gave no sign of departure ""may i ask sir "" said he in an easy conversational fashion ""whether
you can recall principal munro of my college ""
""no sir i cannot "" his uncle answered sharply ""naturally you would not burden your memory to such an extent but he
still remembers you in some conversation with him yesterday he did me
the honour to say that i brought you back to his recollection by what he
was pleased to call the mingled levity and obstinacy of my character the
levity seems to have already impressed you i am now reduced to showing
you the obstinacy "" he sat down in a chair near the door and folded his
arms still beaming pleasantly at his uncle ""oh you won't go "" asked sir charles grimly ""no sir; i will stay ""
""ambrose step down and call a couple of chairmen ""
""i should not advise it sir they will be hurt ""
""i will put you out with my own hands ""
""that sir you can always do as my uncle i could scarce resist you but short of throwing me down the stair i do not see how you can avoid
giving me half an hour of your attention ""
sir charles smiled he could not help it there was so much that was
reminiscent of his own arrogant and eventful youth in the bearing of this
youngster he was mollified too by the defiance of menials and quick
submission to himself he turned to the glass and signed to ambrose to
continue his duties ""i must ask you to await the conclusion of my toilet "" said he ""then we
shall see how far you can justify such an intrusion ""
when the valet had at last left the room sir charles turned his attention
once more to his scapegrace nephew who had viewed the details of the
famous buck's toilet with the face of an acolyte assisting at a mystery ""now sir "" said the older man ""speak and speak to the point for i can
assure you that i have many more important matters which claim my
attention the prince is waiting for me at the present instant at
carlton house be as brief as you can what is it that you want ""
""a thousand pounds ""
""really nothing more "" sir charles had turned acid again ""yes sir; an introduction to mr brinsley sheridan whom i know to be
your friend ""
""and why to him ""
""because i am told that he controls drury lane theatre and i have a
fancy to be an actor my friends assure me that i have a pretty talent
that way ""
""i can see you clearly sir in charles surface or any other part where
a foppish insolence is the essential the less you acted the better you
would be but it is absurd to suppose that i could help you to such a
career i could not justify it to your father return to oxford at
once and continue your studies ""
""impossible ""
""and pray sir what is the impediment ""
""i think i may have mentioned to you that i had an interview yesterday
with the principal he ended it by remarking that the authorities of the
university could tolerate me no more ""
""sent down ""
""yes sir ""
""and this is the fruit no doubt of a long series of rascalities ""
""something of the sort sir i admit ""
in spite of himself sir charles began once more to relax in his severity
towards this handsome young scapegrace his absolute frankness disarmed
criticism it was in a more gracious voice that the older man continued
the conversation ""why do you want this large sum of money "" he asked ""to pay my college debts before i go sir ""
""your father is not a rich man ""
""no sir i could not apply to him for that reason ""
""so you come to me who am a stranger ""
""no sir no you are my uncle and if i may say so my ideal and my
model ""
""you flatter me my good vereker but if you think you can flatter me
out of a thousand pounds you mistake your man i will give you no
money ""
""of course sir if you can't--""
""i did not say i can't i say i won't ""
""if you can sir i think you will ""
sir charles smiled and flicked his sleeve with his lace handkerchief ""i find you vastly entertaining "" said he ""pray continue your
conversation why do you think that i will give you so large a sum of
money ""
""the reason that i think so "" continued the younger man ""is that i can
do you a service which will seem to you worth a thousand pounds ""
sir charles raised his eyebrows in surprise ""is this blackmail "" he inquired vereker tregellis flushed ""sir "" said he with a pleasing sternness ""you surprise me you should
know the blood of which i come too well to suppose that i would attempt
such a thing ""
""i am relieved to hear that there are limits to what you consider to be
justifiable i must confess that i had seen none in your conduct up to
now but you say that you can do me a service which will be worth a
thousand pounds to me ""
""yes sir ""
""and pray sir what may this service be ""
""to make lord barrymore the laughing-stock of the town ""
sir charles in spite of himself lost for an instant the absolute
serenity of his self-control he started and his face expressed his
surprise by what devilish instinct did this raw undergraduate find the
one chink in his armour deep in his heart unacknowledged to any one there was the will to pay many a thousand pounds to the man who would
bring ridicule upon this his most dangerous rival who was challenging
his supremacy in fashionable london ""did you come from oxford with this precious project "" he asked after a
pause ""no sir i chanced to see the man himself last night and i conceived
an ill-will to him and would do him a mischief ""
""where did you see him ""
""i spent the evening sir at the vauxhall gardens ""
""no doubt you would "" interpolated his uncle ""my lord barrymore was there he was attended by one who was dressed as
a clergyman but who was as i am told none other than hooper the
tinman who acts as his bully and thrashes all who may offend him together they passed down the central path insulting the women and
browbeating the men they actually hustled me i was offended sir--so
much so that i nearly took the matter in hand then and there ""
""it is as well that you did not the prizefighter would have beaten
you ""
""perhaps so sir--and also perhaps not ""
""ah you add pugilism to your elegant accomplishments ""
the young man laughed pleasantly ""william ball is the only professor of my alma mater who has ever had
occasion to compliment me sir he is better known as the oxford pet i
think with all modesty that i could hold him for a dozen rounds but
last night i suffered the annoyance without protest for since it is said
that the same scene is enacted every evening there is always time to
act ""
""and how would you act may i ask ""
""that sir i should prefer to keep to myself; but my aim as i say would be to make lord barrymore a laughing-stock to all london ""
sir charles cogitated for a moment ""pray sir "" said he ""why did you imagine that any humiliation to lord
barrymore would be pleasing to me ""
""even in the provinces we know something of what passes in polite
circles your antagonism to this man is to be found in every column of
fashionable gossip the town is divided between you it is impossible
that any public slight upon him should be unpleasing to you ""
sir charles smiled ""you are a shrewd reasoner "" said he ""we will suppose for the instant
that you are right can you give me no hint what means you would adopt
to attain this very desirable end ""
""i would merely make the remark sir that many women have been wronged
by this fellow that is a matter of common knowledge if one of these
damsels were to upbraid him in public in such a fashion that the sympathy
of the bystanders should be with her then i can imagine if she were
sufficiently persistent that his lordship's position might become an
unenviable one ""
""and you know such a woman ""
""i think sir that i do ""
""well my good vereker if any such attempt is in your mind i see no
reason why i should stand between lord barrymore and the angry fair as
to whether the result is worth a thousand pounds i can make no promise ""
""you shall yourself be the judge sir ""
""i will be an exacting judge nephew ""
""very good sir; i should not desire otherwise if things go as i hope his lordship will not show face in st james's street for a year to come i will now if i may give you your instructions ""
""my instructions what do you mean i have nothing to do with the
matter ""
""you are the judge sir and therefore must be present ""
""i can play no part ""
""no sir i would not ask you to do more than be a witness ""
""what then are my instructions as you are pleased to call them ""
""you will come to the gardens to-night uncle at nine o'clock precisely you will walk down the centre path and you will seat yourself upon one
of the rustic seats which are beside the statue of aphrodite you will
wait and you will observe ""
""very good; i will do so i begin to perceive nephew that the breed of
tregellis has not yet lost some of the points which have made it famous ""
it was at the stroke of nine that night when sir charles throwing his
reins to the groom descended from his high yellow phaeton which
forthwith turned to take its place in the long line of fashionable
carriages waiting for their owners as he entered the gate of the
gardens the centre at that time of the dissipation and revelry of
london he turned up the collar of his driving-cape and drew his hat over
his eyes for he had no desire to be personally associated with what
might well prove to be a public scandal in spite of his attempted
disguise however there was that in his walk and his carriage which
caused many an eye to be turned after him as he passed and many a hand to
be raised in salute sir charles walked on and seating himself upon
the rustic bench in front of the famous statue which was in the very
middle of the gardens he waited in amused suspense to see the next act
in this comedy from the pavilion whence the paths radiated there came the strains of
the band of the foot guards and by the many-coloured lamps twinkling
from every tree sir charles could see the confused whirl of the dancers suddenly the music stopped the quadrilles were at an end an instant afterwards the central path by which he sat was thronged by
the revellers in a many-coloured crowd stocked and cravated with all
the bravery of buff and plum-colour and blue the bucks of the town
passed and repassed with their high-waisted straight-skirted be-bonneted ladies upon their arms it was not a decorous assembly many of the men flushed and noisy had
come straight from their potations the women too were loud and
aggressive now and then with a rush and a swirl amid a chorus of
screams from the girls and good-humoured laughter from their escorts some band of high-blooded noisy youths would break their way across the
moving throng it was no place for the prim or demure and there was a
spirit of good-nature and merriment among the crowd which condoned the
wildest liberty and yet there were some limits to what could be tolerated even by so
bohemian an assembly a murmur of anger followed in the wake of two
roisterers who were making their way down the path it would perhaps be fairer to say one roisterer; for of the two it was only the first who
carried himself with such insolence although it was the second who
ensured that he could do it with impunity the leader was a very tall hatchet-faced man dressed in the very height
of fashion whose evil handsome features were flushed with wine and
arrogance he shouldered his way roughly through the crowd peering with
an abominable smile into the faces of the women and occasionally where
the weakness of the escort invited an insult stretching out his hand and
caressing the cheek or neck of some passing girl laughing loudly as she
winced away from his touch close at his heels walked his hired attendant whom out of insolent
caprice and with a desire to show his contempt for the prejudices of
others he had dressed as a rough country clergyman this fellow
slouched along with frowning brows and surly challenging eyes like some
faithful hideous human bulldog his knotted hands protruding from his
rusty cassock his great underhung jaw turning slowly from right to left
as he menaced the crowd with his sinister gaze already a close observer
might have marked upon his face a heaviness and looseness of feature the
first signs of that physical decay which in a very few years was to
stretch him a helpless wreck too weak to utter his own name upon the
causeway of the london streets at present however he was still an
unbeaten man the terror of the ring and as his ill-omened face was seen
behind his infamous master many a half-raised cane was lowered and many a
hot word was checked while the whisper of ""hooper 'ware bully hooper ""
warned all who were aggrieved that it might be best to pocket their
injuries lest some even worse thing should befall them many a maimed
and disfigured man had carried away from vauxhall the handiwork of the
tinman and his patron moving in insolent slowness through the crowd the bully and his master
had just come opposite to the bench upon which sat sir charles tregellis at this place the path opened up into a circular space brilliantly
illuminated and surrounded by rustic seats from one of these an
elderly ringleted woman deeply veiled rose suddenly and barred the
path of the swaggering nobleman her voice sounded clear and strident
above the babel of tongues which hushed suddenly that their owners might
hear it ""marry her my lord i entreat you to marry her oh surely you will
marry my poor amelia "" said the voice lord barrymore stood aghast from all sides folk were closing in and
heads were peering over shoulders he tried to push on but the lady
barred his way and two palms pressed upon his beruffled front ""surely surely you would not desert her take the advice of that good kind clergyman behind you "" wailed the voice ""oh be a man of honour
and marry her ""
the elderly lady thrust out her hand and drew forward a lumpish-looking
young woman who sobbed and mopped her eyes with her handkerchief ""the plague take you "" roared his lordship in a fury ""who is the
wench i vow that i never clapped eyes on either of you in my life ""
""it is my niece amelia "" cried the lady ""your own loving amelia oh my
lord can you pretend that you have forgotten poor trusting amelia of
woodbine cottage at lichfield ""
""i never set foot in lichfield in my life "" cried the peer ""you are two
impostors who should be whipped at the cart's tail ""
""oh wicked oh amelia "" screamed the lady in a voice that resounded
through the gardens ""oh my darling try to soften his hard heart; pray
him that he make an honest woman of you at last ""
with a lurch the stout young woman fell forward and embraced lord
barrymore with the hug of a bear he would have raised his cane but his
arms were pinned to his sides ""hooper hooper "" screamed the furious peer craning his neck in horror for the girl seemed to be trying to kiss him but the bruiser as he ran forward found himself entangled with the old
lady ""out o' the way marm "" he cried ""out o' the way i say "" and pushed
her violently aside ""oh you rude rude man "" she shrieked springing back in front of him ""he hustled me good people; you saw him hustle me a clergyman but no
gentleman what you would treat a lady so--you would do it again oh i could slap slap slap you ""
and with each repetition of the word with extraordinary swiftness her
open palm rang upon the prizefighter's cheek the crowd buzzed with amazement and delight ""hooper hooper "" cried lord barrymore once more for he was still
struggling in the ever-closer embrace of the unwieldy and amorous amelia the bully again pushed forward to the aid of his patron but again the
elderly lady confronted him her head back her left arm extended her
whole attitude to his amazement that of an expert boxer the prizefighter's brutal nature was roused woman or no woman he would
show the murmuring crowd what it meant to cross the path of the tinman she had struck him she must take the consequence no one should square
up to him with impunity he swung his right with a curse the bonnet
instantly ducked under his arm and a line of razor-like knuckles left an
open cut under his eye amid wild cries of delight and encouragement from the dense circle of
spectators the lady danced round the sham clergyman dodging his
ponderous blows slipping under his arms and smacking back at him most
successfully once she tripped and fell over her own skirt but was up
and at him again in an instant ""you vulgar fellow "" she shrieked ""would you strike a helpless woman take that oh you rude and ill-bred man ""
bully hooper was cowed for the first time in his life by the
extraordinary thing that he was fighting the creature was as elusive as
a shadow and yet the blood was dripping down his chin from the effects
of the blows he shrank back with an amazed face from so uncanny an
antagonist and in the moment that he did so his spell was for ever
broken only success could hold it a check was fatal in all the
crowd there was scarce one who was not nursing some grievance against
master or man and waiting for that moment of weakness in which to
revenge it with a growl of rage the circle closed in there was an eddy of furious struggling men with lord barrymore's thin flushed face and hooper's
bulldog jowl in the centre of it a moment after they were both upon the
ground and a dozen sticks were rising and falling above them ""let me up you're killing me for god's sake let me up "" cried a
crackling voice hooper fought mute like the bulldog he was till his senses were beaten
out of him bruised kicked and mauled never did their worst victim come so badly
from the gardens as the bully and his patron that night but worse than
the ache of wounds for lord barrymore was the smart of the mind as he
thought how every club and drawing-room in london would laugh for a week
to come at the tale of his amelia and her aunt sir charles had stood rocking with laughter upon the bench which
overlooked the scene when at last he made his way back through the
crowds to his yellow phaeton he was not entirely surprised to find that
the back seat was already occupied by two giggling females who were
exchanging most unladylike repartees with the attendant grooms ""you young rascals "" he remarked over his shoulder as he gathered up
his reins the two females tittered loudly ""uncle charles "" cried the elder ""may i present mr jack jarvis of
brasenose college i think uncle you should take us somewhere to sup for it has been a vastly fatiguing performance to-morrow i will do
myself the honour to call at your convenience and will venture to bring
with me the receipt for one thousand pounds """
Chapter 5,"v the horror of the heights
(which includes the manuscript known as the joyce-armstrong fragment)
the idea that the extraordinary narrative which has been called the joyce-
armstrong fragment is an elaborate practical joke evolved by some unknown
person cursed by a perverted and sinister sense of humour has now been
abandoned by all who have examined the matter the most _macabre_ and
imaginative of plotters would hesitate before linking his morbid fancies
with the unquestioned and tragic facts which reinforce the statement though the assertions contained in it are amazing and even monstrous it
is none the less forcing itself upon the general intelligence that they
are true and that we must readjust our ideas to the new situation this
world of ours appears to be separated by a slight and precarious margin
of safety from a most singular and unexpected danger i will endeavour
in this narrative which reproduces the original document in its
necessarily somewhat fragmentary form to lay before the reader the whole
of the facts up to date prefacing my statement by saying that if there
be any who doubt the narrative of joyce-armstrong there can be no
question at all as to the facts concerning lieutenant myrtle r n and
mr hay connor who undoubtedly met their end in the manner described the joyce-armstrong fragment was found in the field which is called lower
haycock lying one mile to the westward of the village of withyham upon
the kent and sussex border it was on the fifteenth of september last
that an agricultural labourer james flynn in the employment of mathew
dodd farmer of the chauntry farm withyham perceived a briar pipe
lying near the footpath which skirts the hedge in lower haycock a few
paces farther on he picked up a pair of broken binocular glasses finally among some nettles in the ditch he caught sight of a flat canvas-backed book which proved to be a note-book with detachable
leaves some of which had come loose and were fluttering along the base
of the hedge these he collected but some including the first were
never recovered and leave a deplorable hiatus in this all-important
statement the notebook was taken by the labourer to his master who in
turn showed it to dr j h atherton of hartfield this gentleman at
once recognised the need for an expert examination and the manuscript
was forwarded to the aero club in london where it now lies the first two pages of the manuscript are missing there is also one
torn away at the end of the narrative though none of these affect the
general coherence of the story it is conjectured that the missing
opening is concerned with the record of mr joyce-armstrong's
qualifications as an aeronaut which can be gathered from other sources
and are admitted to be unsurpassed among the air-pilots of england for
many years he has been looked upon as among the most daring and the most
intellectual of flying men a combination which has enabled him to both
invent and test several new devices including the common gyroscopic
attachment which is known by his name the main body of the manuscript
is written neatly in ink but the last few lines are in pencil and are so
ragged as to be hardly legible--exactly in fact as they might be
expected to appear if they were scribbled off hurriedly from the seat of
a moving aeroplane there are it may be added several stains both on
the last page and on the outside cover which have been pronounced by the
home office experts to be blood--probably human and certainly mammalian the fact that something closely resembling the organism of malaria was
discovered in this blood and that joyce-armstrong is known to have
suffered from intermittent fever is a remarkable example of the new
weapons which modern science has placed in the hands of our detectives and now a word as to the personality of the author of this epoch-making
statement joyce-armstrong according to the few friends who really knew
something of the man was a poet and a dreamer as well as a mechanic and
an inventor he was a man of considerable wealth much of which he had
spent in the pursuit of his aeronautical hobby he had four private
aeroplanes in his hangars near devizes and is said to have made no fewer
than one hundred and seventy ascents in the course of last year he was
a retiring man with dark moods in which he would avoid the society of
his fellows captain dangerfield who knew him better than any one says
that there were times when his eccentricity threatened to develop into
something more serious his habit of carrying a shot-gun with him in his
aeroplane was one manifestation of it another was the morbid effect which the fall of lieutenant myrtle had
upon his mind myrtle who was attempting the height record fell from
an altitude of something over thirty thousand feet horrible to narrate his head was entirely obliterated though his body and limbs preserved
their configuration at every gathering of airmen joyce-armstrong according to dangerfield would ask with an enigmatic smile: ""and where pray is myrtle's head ""
on another occasion after dinner at the mess of the flying school on
salisbury plain he started a debate as to what will be the most
permanent danger which airmen will have to encounter having listened to
successive opinions as to air-pockets faulty construction and
over-banking he ended by shrugging his shoulders and refusing to put
forward his own views though he gave the impression that they differed
from any advanced by his companions it is worth remarking that after his own complete disappearance it was
found that his private affairs were arranged with a precision which may
show that he had a strong premonition of disaster with these essential
explanations i will now give the narrative exactly as it stands beginning at page three of the blood-soaked note-book:--
""nevertheless when i dined at rheims with coselli and gustav raymond i
found that neither of them was aware of any particular danger in the
higher layers of the atmosphere i did not actually say what was in my
thoughts but i got so near to it that if they had any corresponding idea
they could not have failed to express it but then they are two empty vainglorious fellows with no thought beyond seeing their silly names in
the newspaper it is interesting to note that neither of them had ever
been much beyond the twenty-thousand-foot level of course men have
been higher than this both in balloons and in the ascent of mountains it
must be well above that point that the aeroplane enters the danger
zone--always presuming that my premonitions are correct ""aeroplaning has been with us now for more than twenty years and one
might well ask: why should this peril be only revealing itself in our
day the answer is obvious in the old days of weak engines when a
hundred horse-power gnome or green was considered ample for every need the flights were very restricted now that three hundred horse-power is
the rule rather than the exception visits to the upper layers have
become easier and more common some of us can remember how in our
youth garros made a world-wide reputation by attaining nineteen thousand
feet and it was considered a remarkable achievement to fly over the
alps our standard now has been immeasurably raised and there are
twenty high flights for one in former years many of them have been
undertaken with impunity the thirty-thousand-foot level has been
reached time after time with no discomfort beyond cold and asthma what
does this prove a visitor might descend upon this planet a thousand
times and never see a tiger yet tigers exist and if he chanced to come
down into a jungle he might be devoured there are jungles of the upper
air and there are worse things than tigers which inhabit them i
believe in time they will map these jungles accurately out even at the
present moment i could name two of them one of them lies over the pau-
biarritz district of france another is just over my head as i write
here in my house in wiltshire i rather think there is a third in the
homburg-wiesbaden district ""it was the disappearance of the airmen that first set me thinking of
course every one said that they had fallen into the sea but that did
not satisfy me at all first there was verrier in france; his machine
was found near bayonne but they never got his body there was the case
of baxter also who vanished though his engine and some of the iron
fixings were found in a wood in leicestershire in that case dr middleton of amesbury who was watching the flight with a telescope declares that just before the clouds obscured the view he saw the
machine which was at an enormous height suddenly rise perpendicularly
upwards in a succession of jerks in a manner that he would have thought
to be impossible that was the last seen of baxter there was a
correspondence in the papers but it never led to anything there were
several other similar cases and then there was the death of hay connor what a cackle there was about an unsolved mystery of the air and what
columns in the halfpenny papers and yet how little was ever done to get
to the bottom of the business he came down in a tremendous vol-plane
from an unknown height he never got off his machine and died in his
pilot's seat died of what 'heart disease ' said the doctors rubbish hay connor's heart was as sound as mine is what did venables say venables was the only man who was at his side when he died he said that
he was shivering and looked like a man who had been badly scared 'died
of fright ' said venables but could not imagine what he was frightened
about only said one word to venables which sounded like 'monstrous '
they could make nothing of that at the inquest but i could make
something of it monsters that was the last word of poor harry hay
connor and he _did_ die of fright just as venables thought ""and then there was myrtle's head do you really believe--does anybody
really believe--that a man's head could be driven clean into his body by
the force of a fall well perhaps it may be possible but i for one have never believed that it was so with myrtle and the grease upon his
clothes--'all slimy with grease ' said somebody at the inquest queer
that nobody got thinking after that i did--but then i had been
thinking for a good long time i've made three ascents--how dangerfield
used to chaff me about my shot-gun --but i've never been high enough now with this new light paul veroner machine and its one hundred and
seventy-five robur i should easily touch the thirty thousand to-morrow i'll have a shot at the record maybe i shall have a shot at something
else as well of course it's dangerous if a fellow wants to avoid
danger he had best keep out of flying altogether and subside finally into
flannel slippers and a dressing-gown but i'll visit the air-jungle to-
morrow--and if there's anything there i shall know it if i return i'll
find myself a bit of a celebrity if i don't this note-book may explain
what i am trying to do and how i lost my life in doing it but no
drivel about accidents or mysteries if _you_ please ""i chose my paul veroner monoplane for the job there's nothing like a
monoplane when real work is to be done beaumont found that out in very
early days for one thing it doesn't mind damp and the weather looks
as if we should be in the clouds all the time it's a bonny little model
and answers my hand like a tender-mouthed horse the engine is a ten-
cylinder rotary robur working up to one hundred and seventy-five it has
all the modern improvements--enclosed fuselage high-curved landing
skids brakes gyroscopic steadiers and three speeds worked by an
alteration of the angle of the planes upon the venetian-blind principle i took a shot-gun with me and a dozen cartridges filled with buck-shot you should have seen the face of perkins my old mechanic when i
directed him to put them in i was dressed like an arctic explorer with
two jerseys under my overalls thick socks inside my padded boots a
storm-cap with flaps and my talc goggles it was stifling outside the
hangars but i was going for the summit of the himalayas and had to
dress for the part perkins knew there was something on and implored me
to take him with me perhaps i should if i were using the biplane but a
monoplane is a one-man show--if you want to get the last foot of lift out
of it of course i took an oxygen bag; the man who goes for the
altitude record without one will either be frozen or smothered--or both ""i had a good look at the planes the rudder-bar and the elevating lever
before i got in everything was in order so far as i could see then i
switched on my engine and found that she was running sweetly when they
let her go she rose almost at once upon the lowest speed i circled my
home field once or twice just to warm her up and then with a wave to
perkins and the others i flattened out my planes and put her on her
highest she skimmed like a swallow down wind for eight or ten miles
until i turned her nose up a little and she began to climb in a great
spiral for the cloud-bank above me it's all-important to rise slowly
and adapt yourself to the pressure as you go ""it was a close warm day for an english september and there was the
hush and heaviness of impending rain now and then there came sudden
puffs of wind from the south-west--one of them so gusty and unexpected
that it caught me napping and turned me half-round for an instant i
remember the time when gusts and whirls and air-pockets used to be things
of danger--before we learned to put an overmastering power into our
engines just as i reached the cloud-banks with the altimeter marking
three thousand down came the rain my word how it poured it drummed
upon my wings and lashed against my face blurring my glasses so that i
could hardly see i got down on to a low speed for it was painful to
travel against it as i got higher it became hail and i had to turn
tail to it one of my cylinders was out of action--a dirty plug i
should imagine but still i was rising steadily with plenty of power after a bit the trouble passed whatever it was and i heard the full deep-throated purr--the ten singing as one that's where the beauty of
our modern silencers comes in we can at last control our engines by
ear how they squeal and squeak and sob when they are in trouble all
those cries for help were wasted in the old days when every sound was
swallowed up by the monstrous racket of the machine if only the early
aviators could come back to see the beauty and perfection of the
mechanism which have been bought at the cost of their lives ""about nine-thirty i was nearing the clouds down below me all blurred
and shadowed with rain lay the vast expanse of salisbury plain half-a-
dozen flying machines were doing hackwork at the thousand-foot level looking like little black swallows against the green background i dare
say they were wondering what i was doing up in cloud-land suddenly a
grey curtain drew across beneath me and the wet folds of vapour were
swirling round my face it was clammily cold and miserable but i was
above the hail-storm and that was something gained the cloud was as
dark and thick as a london fog in my anxiety to get clear i cocked her
nose up until the automatic alarm-bell rang and i actually began to
slide backwards my sopped and dripping wings had made me heavier than i
thought but presently i was in lighter cloud and soon had cleared the
first layer there was a second--opal-coloured and fleecy--at a great
height above my head a white unbroken ceiling above and a dark unbroken
floor below with the monoplane labouring upwards upon a vast spiral
between them it is deadly lonely in these cloud-spaces once a great
flight of some small water-birds went past me flying very fast to the
westwards the quick whirr of their wings and their musical cry were
cheery to my ear i fancy that they were teal but i am a wretched
zoologist now that we humans have become birds we must really learn to
know our brethren by sight ""the wind down beneath me whirled and swayed the broad cloud-plain once
a great eddy formed in it a whirlpool of vapour and through it as down
a funnel i caught sight of the distant world a large white biplane was
passing at a vast depth beneath me i fancy it was the morning mail
service betwixt bristol and london then the drift swirled inwards again
and the great solitude was unbroken ""just after ten i touched the lower edge of the upper cloud-stratum it
consisted of fine diaphanous vapour drifting swiftly from the westward the wind had been steadily rising all this time and it was now blowing a
sharp breeze--twenty-eight an hour by my gauge already it was very
cold though my altimeter only marked nine thousand the engines were
working beautifully and we went droning steadily upwards the cloud-
bank was thicker than i had expected but at last it thinned out into a
golden mist before me and then in an instant i had shot out from it and
there was an unclouded sky and a brilliant sun above my head--all blue
and gold above all shining silver below one vast glimmering plain as
far as my eyes could reach it was a quarter past ten o'clock and the
barograph needle pointed to twelve thousand eight hundred up i went and
up my ears concentrated upon the deep purring of my motor my eyes busy
always with the watch the revolution indicator the petrol lever and
the oil pump no wonder aviators are said to be a fearless race with
so many things to think of there is no time to trouble about oneself about this time i noted how unreliable is the compass when above a
certain height from earth at fifteen thousand feet mine was pointing
east and a point south the sun and the wind gave me my true bearings ""i had hoped to reach an eternal stillness in these high altitudes but
with every thousand feet of ascent the gale grew stronger my machine
groaned and trembled in every joint and rivet as she faced it and swept
away like a sheet of paper when i banked her on the turn skimming down
wind at a greater pace perhaps than ever mortal man has moved yet i
had always to turn again and tack up in the wind's eye for it was not
merely a height record that i was after by all my calculations it was
above little wiltshire that my air-jungle lay and all my labour might be
lost if i struck the outer layers at some farther point ""when i reached the nineteen-thousand-foot level which was about midday the wind was so severe that i looked with some anxiety to the stays of my
wings expecting momentarily to see them snap or slacken i even cast
loose the parachute behind me and fastened its hook into the ring of my
leathern belt so as to be ready for the worst now was the time when a
bit of scamped work by the mechanic is paid for by the life of the
aeronaut but she held together bravely every cord and strut was
humming and vibrating like so many harp-strings but it was glorious to
see how for all the beating and the buffeting she was still the
conqueror of nature and the mistress of the sky there is surely
something divine in man himself that he should rise so superior to the
limitations which creation seemed to impose--rise too by such
unselfish heroic devotion as this air-conquest has shown talk of human
degeneration when has such a story as this been written in the annals
of our race ""these were the thoughts in my head as i climbed that monstrous inclined
plane with the wind sometimes beating in my face and sometimes whistling
behind my ears while the cloud-land beneath me fell away to such a
distance that the folds and hummocks of silver had all smoothed out into
one flat shining plain but suddenly i had a horrible and unprecedented
experience i have known before what it is to be in what our neighbours
have called a _tourbillon_ but never on such a scale as this that
huge sweeping river of wind of which i have spoken had as it appears whirlpools within it which were as monstrous as itself without a
moment's warning i was dragged suddenly into the heart of one i spun
round for a minute or two with such velocity that i almost lost my
senses and then fell suddenly left wing foremost down the vacuum
funnel in the centre i dropped like a stone and lost nearly a thousand
feet it was only my belt that kept me in my seat and the shock and
breathlessness left me hanging half-insensible over the side of the
fuselage but i am always capable of a supreme effort--it is my one
great merit as an aviator i was conscious that the descent was slower the whirlpool was a cone rather than a funnel and i had come to the
apex with a terrific wrench throwing my weight all to one side i
levelled my planes and brought her head away from the wind in an
instant i had shot out of the eddies and was skimming down the sky then shaken but victorious i turned her nose up and began once more my steady
grind on the upward spiral i took a large sweep to avoid the danger-
spot of the whirlpool and soon i was safely above it just after one
o'clock i was twenty-one thousand feet above the sea-level to my great
joy i had topped the gale and with every hundred feet of ascent the air
grew stiller on the other hand it was very cold and i was conscious
of that peculiar nausea which goes with rarefaction of the air for the
first time i unscrewed the mouth of my oxygen bag and took an occasional
whiff of the glorious gas i could feel it running like a cordial
through my veins and i was exhilarated almost to the point of
drunkenness i shouted and sang as i soared upwards into the cold still
outer world ""it is very clear to me that the insensibility which came upon glaisher and in a lesser degree upon coxwell when in 1862 they ascended in a
balloon to the height of thirty thousand feet was due to the extreme
speed with which a perpendicular ascent is made doing it at an easy
gradient and accustoming oneself to the lessened barometric pressure by
slow degrees there are no such dreadful symptoms at the same great
height i found that even without my oxygen inhaler i could breathe
without undue distress it was bitterly cold however and my
thermometer was at zero fahrenheit at one-thirty i was nearly seven
miles above the surface of the earth and still ascending steadily i
found however that the rarefied air was giving markedly less support to
my planes and that my angle of ascent had to be considerably lowered in
consequence it was already clear that even with my light weight and
strong engine-power there was a point in front of me where i should be
held to make matters worse one of my sparking-plugs was in trouble
again and there was intermittent missfiring in the engine my heart was
heavy with the fear of failure ""it was about that time that i had a most extraordinary experience something whizzed past me in a trail of smoke and exploded with a loud hissing sound sending forth a cloud of steam for the instant i could
not imagine what had happened then i remembered that the earth is for
ever being bombarded by meteor stones and would be hardly inhabitable
were they not in nearly every case turned to vapour in the outer layers
of the atmosphere here is a new danger for the high-altitude man for
two others passed me when i was nearing the forty-thousand-foot mark i
cannot doubt that at the edge of the earth's envelope the risk would be a
very real one ""my barograph needle marked forty-one thousand three hundred when i
became aware that i could go no farther physically the strain was not
as yet greater than i could bear but my machine had reached its limit the attenuated air gave no firm support to the wings and the least tilt
developed into side-slip while she seemed sluggish on her controls possibly had the engine been at its best another thousand feet might
have been within our capacity but it was still missfiring and two out
of the ten cylinders appeared to be out of action if i had not already
reached the zone for which i was searching then i should never see it
upon this journey but was it not possible that i had attained it soaring in circles like a monstrous hawk upon the forty-thousand-foot
level i let the monoplane guide herself and with my mannheim glass i
made a careful observation of my surroundings the heavens were
perfectly clear; there was no indication of those dangers which i had
imagined ""i have said that i was soaring in circles it struck me suddenly that i
would do well to take a wider sweep and open up a new air-tract if the
hunter entered an earth-jungle he would drive through it if he wished to
find his game my reasoning had led me to believe that the air-jungle
which i had imagined lay somewhere over wiltshire this should be to the
south and west of me i took my bearings from the sun for the compass
was hopeless and no trace of earth was to be seen--nothing but the
distant silver cloud-plain however i got my direction as best i might
and kept her head straight to the mark i reckoned that my petrol supply
would not last for more than another hour or so but i could afford to
use it to the last drop since a single magnificent vol-plane could at
any time take me to the earth ""suddenly i was aware of something new the air in front of me had lost
its crystal clearness it was full of long ragged wisps of something
which i can only compare to very fine cigarette-smoke it hung about in
wreaths and coils turning and twisting slowly in the sunlight as the
monoplane shot through it i was aware of a faint taste of oil upon my
lips and there was a greasy scum upon the woodwork of the machine some
infinitely fine organic matter appeared to be suspended in the
atmosphere there was no life there it was inchoate and diffuse extending for many square acres and then fringing off into the void no it was not life but might it not be the remains of life above all might it not be the food of life of monstrous life even as the humble
grease of the ocean is the food for the mighty whale the thought was in
my mind when my eyes looked upwards and i saw the most wonderful vision
that ever man has seen can i hope to convey it to you even as i saw it
myself last thursday ""conceive a jelly-fish such as sails in our summer seas bell-shaped and
of enormous size--far larger i should judge than the dome of st paul's it was of a light pink colour veined with a delicate green but
the whole huge fabric so tenuous that it was but a fairy outline against
the dark blue sky it pulsated with a delicate and regular rhythm from
it there depended two long drooping green tentacles which swayed slowly
backwards and forwards this gorgeous vision passed gently with
noiseless dignity over my head as light and fragile as a soap-bubble and drifted upon its stately way ""i had half-turned my monoplane that i might look after this beautiful
creature when in a moment i found myself amidst a perfect fleet of
them of all sizes but none so large as the first some were quite
small but the majority about as big as an average balloon and with much
the same curvature at the top there was in them a delicacy of texture
and colouring which reminded me of the finest venetian glass pale
shades of pink and green were the prevailing tints but all had a lovely
iridescence where the sun shimmered through their dainty forms some
hundreds of them drifted past me a wonderful fairy squadron of strange unknown argosies of the sky--creatures whose forms and substance were so
attuned to these pure heights that one could not conceive anything so
delicate within actual sight or sound of earth ""but soon my attention was drawn to a new phenomenon--the serpents of the
outer air these were long thin fantastic coils of vapour-like
material which turned and twisted with great speed flying round and
round at such a pace that the eyes could hardly follow them some of
these ghost-like creatures were twenty or thirty feet long but it was
difficult to tell their girth for their outline was so hazy that it
seemed to fade away into the air around them these air-snakes were of a
very light grey or smoke colour with some darker lines within which
gave the impression of a definite organism one of them whisked past my
very face and i was conscious of a cold clammy contact but their
composition was so unsubstantial that i could not connect them with any
thought of physical danger any more than the beautiful bell-like
creatures which had preceded them there was no more solidity in their
frames than in the floating spume from a broken wave ""but a more terrible experience was in store for me floating downwards
from a great height there came a purplish patch of vapour small as i saw
it first but rapidly enlarging as it approached me until it appeared to
be hundreds of square feet in size though fashioned of some
transparent jelly-like substance it was none the less of much more
definite outline and solid consistence than anything which i had seen
before there were more traces too of a physical organization especially two vast shadowy circular plates upon either side which may
have been eyes and a perfectly solid white projection between them which
was as curved and cruel as the beak of a vulture ""the whole aspect of this monster was formidable and threatening and it
kept changing its colour from a very light mauve to a dark angry purple
so thick that it cast a shadow as it drifted between my monoplane and the
sun on the upper curve of its huge body there were three great
projections which i can only describe as enormous bubbles and i was
convinced as i looked at them that they were charged with some extremely
light gas which served to buoy-up the misshapen and semi-solid mass in
the rarefied air the creature moved swiftly along keeping pace easily
with the monoplane and for twenty miles or more it formed my horrible
escort hovering over me like a bird of prey which is waiting to pounce its method of progression--done so swiftly that it was not easy to
follow--was to throw out a long glutinous streamer in front of it which
in turn seemed to draw forward the rest of the writhing body so elastic
and gelatinous was it that never for two successive minutes was it the
same shape and yet each change made it more threatening and loathsome
than the last ""i knew that it meant mischief every purple flush of its hideous body
told me so the vague goggling eyes which were turned always upon me
were cold and merciless in their viscid hatred i dipped the nose of my
monoplane downwards to escape it as i did so as quick as a flash there
shot out a long tentacle from this mass of floating blubber and it fell
as light and sinuous as a whip-lash across the front of my machine there
was a loud hiss as it lay for a moment across the hot engine and it
whisked itself into the air again while the huge flat body drew itself
together as if in sudden pain i dipped to a vol-pique but again a
tentacle fell over the monoplane and was shorn off by the propeller as
easily as it might have cut through a smoke wreath a long gliding sticky serpent-like coil came from behind and caught me round the waist dragging me out of the fuselage i tore at it my fingers sinking into
the smooth glue-like surface and for an instant i disengaged myself but only to be caught round the boot by another coil which gave me a
jerk that tilted me almost on to my back ""as i fell over i blazed off both barrels of my gun though indeed it
was like attacking an elephant with a pea-shooter to imagine that any
human weapon could cripple that mighty bulk and yet i aimed better than
i knew for with a loud report one of the great blisters upon the
creature's back exploded with the puncture of the buck-shot it was very
clear that my conjecture was right and that these vast clear bladders
were distended with some lifting gas for in an instant the huge cloud-
like body turned sideways writhing desperately to find its balance while the white beak snapped and gaped in horrible fury but already i
had shot away on the steepest glide that i dared to attempt my engine
still full on the flying propeller and the force of gravity shooting me
downwards like an aerolite far behind me i saw a dull purplish smudge
growing swiftly smaller and merging into the blue sky behind it i was
safe out of the deadly jungle of the outer air ""once out of danger i throttled my engine for nothing tears a machine to
pieces quicker than running on full power from a height it was a
glorious spiral vol-plane from nearly eight miles of altitude--first to
the level of the silver cloud-bank then to that of the storm-cloud
beneath it and finally in beating rain to the surface of the earth i
saw the bristol channel beneath me as i broke from the clouds but having still some petrol in my tank i got twenty miles inland before i
found myself stranded in a field half a mile from the village of
ashcombe there i got three tins of petrol from a passing motor-car and
at ten minutes past six that evening i alighted gently in my own home
meadow at devizes after such a journey as no mortal upon earth has ever
yet taken and lived to tell the tale i have seen the beauty and i have
seen the horror of the heights--and greater beauty or greater horror than
that is not within the ken of man ""and now it is my plan to go once again before i give my results to the
world my reason for this is that i must surely have something to show
by way of proof before i lay such a tale before my fellow-men it is
true that others will soon follow and will confirm what i have said and
yet i should wish to carry conviction from the first those lovely
iridescent bubbles of the air should not be hard to capture they drift
slowly upon their way and the swift monoplane could intercept their
leisurely course it is likely enough that they would dissolve in the
heavier layers of the atmosphere and that some small heap of amorphous
jelly might be all that i should bring to earth with me and yet
something there would surely be by which i could substantiate my story yes i will go even if i run a risk by doing so these purple horrors
would not seem to be numerous it is probable that i shall not see one if i do i shall dive at once at the worst there is always the shot-gun
and my knowledge of ""
here a page of the manuscript is unfortunately missing on the next page
is written in large straggling writing:--
""forty-three thousand feet i shall never see earth again they are
beneath me three of them god help me; it is a dreadful death to die ""
such in its entirety is the joyce-armstrong statement of the man
nothing has since been seen pieces of his shattered monoplane have been
picked up in the preserves of mr budd-lushington upon the borders of
kent and sussex within a few miles of the spot where the note-book was
discovered if the unfortunate aviator's theory is correct that this air-
jungle as he called it existed only over the south-west of england then it would seem that he had fled from it at the full speed of his
monoplane but had been overtaken and devoured by these horrible
creatures at some spot in the outer atmosphere above the place where the
grim relics were found the picture of that monoplane skimming down the
sky with the nameless terrors flying as swiftly beneath it and cutting
it off always from the earth while they gradually closed in upon their
victim is one upon which a man who valued his sanity would prefer not to
dwell there are many as i am aware who still jeer at the facts which
i have here set down but even they must admit that joyce-armstrong has
disappeared and i would commend to them his own words: ""this note-book
may explain what i am trying to do and how i lost my life in doing it but no drivel about accidents or mysteries if _you_ please """
Chapter 6,"vi borrowed scenes
 ""it cannot be done people really would not stand it i know because
 i have tried ""--_extract from an unpublished paper upon george borrow
 and his writings_ yes i tried and my experience may interest other people you must
imagine then that i am soaked in george borrow especially in his
_lavengro_ and his _romany rye_ that i have modelled both my thoughts my speech and my style very carefully upon those of the master and that
finally i set forth one summer day actually to lead the life of which i
had read behold me then upon the country road which leads from the
railway-station to the sussex village of swinehurst as i walked i entertained myself by recollections of the founders of
sussex of cerdic that mighty sea-rover and of ella his son said by the
bard to be taller by the length of a spear-head than the tallest of his
fellows i mentioned the matter twice to peasants whom i met upon the
road one a tallish man with a freckled face sidled past me and ran
swiftly towards the station the other a smaller and older man stood
entranced while i recited to him that passage of the saxon chronicle
which begins ""then came leija with longships forty-four and the fyrd
went out against him "" i was pointing out to him that the chronicle had
been written partly by the monks of saint albans and afterwards by those
of peterborough but the fellow sprang suddenly over a gate and
disappeared the village of swinehurst is a straggling line of half-timbered houses of
the early english pattern one of these houses stood as i observed somewhat taller than the rest and seeing by its appearance and by the
sign which hung before it that it was the village inn i approached it for indeed i had not broken my fast since i had left london a stoutish
man five foot eight perhaps in height with black coat and trousers of a
greyish shade stood outside and to him i talked in the fashion of the
master ""why a rose and why a crown "" i asked as i pointed upwards he looked at me in a strange manner the man's whole appearance was
strange ""why not "" he answered and shrank a little backwards ""the sign of a king "" said i ""surely "" said he ""what else should we understand from a crown ""
""and which king "" i asked ""you will excuse me "" said he and tried to pass ""which king "" i repeated ""how should i know "" he asked ""you should know by the rose "" said i ""which is the symbol of that tudor-
ap-tudor who coming from the mountains of wales yet seated his
posterity upon the english throne tudor "" i continued getting between
the stranger and the door of the inn through which he appeared to be
desirous of passing ""was of the same blood as owen glendower the famous
chieftain who is by no means to be confused with owen gwynedd the
father of madoc of the sea of whom the bard made the famous cnylyn which runs in the welsh as follows:--""
i was about to repeat the famous stanza of dafydd-ap-gwilyn when the man who had looked very fixedly and strangely at me as i spoke pushed past
me and entered the inn ""truly "" said i aloud ""it is surely swinehurst
to which i have come since the same means the grove of the hogs "" so
saying i followed the fellow into the bar parlour where i perceived him
seated in a corner with a large chair in front of him four persons of
various degrees were drinking beer at a central table whilst a small man
of active build in a black shiny suit which seemed to have seen much
service stood before the empty fireplace him i took to be the
landlord and i asked him what i should have for my dinner he smiled and said that he could not tell ""but surely my friend "" said i ""you can tell me what is ready ""
""even that i cannot do "" he answered; ""but i doubt not that the landlord
can inform us "" on this he rang the bell and a fellow answered to whom
i put the same question ""what would you have "" he asked i thought of the master and i ordered a cold leg of pork to be washed
down with tea and beer ""did you say tea _and_ beer "" asked the landlord ""i did ""
""for twenty-five years have i been in business "" said the landlord ""and
never before have i been asked for tea and beer ""
""the gentleman is joking "" said the man with the shining coat ""or else--"" said the elderly man in the corner ""or what sir "" i asked ""nothing "" said he--""nothing "" there was something very strange in this
man in the corner--him to whom i had spoken of dafydd-ap-gwilyn ""then you are joking "" said the landlord i asked him if he had read the works of my master george borrow he
said that he had not i told him that in those five volumes he would
not from cover to cover find one trace of any sort of a joke he would
also find that my master drank tea and beer together now it happens
that about tea i have read nothing either in the sagas or in the bardic
cnylynions but whilst the landlord had departed to prepare my meal i
recited to the company those icelandic stanzas which praise the beer of
gunnar the long-haired son of harold the bear then lest the language
should be unknown to some of them i recited my own translation ending
with the line--
 if the beer be small then let the mug be large i then asked the company whether they went to church or to chapel the
question surprised them and especially the strange man in the corner upon whom i now fixed my eye i had read his secret and as i looked at
him he tried to shrink behind the clock-case ""the church or the chapel "" i asked him ""the church "" he gasped ""_which_ church "" i asked he shrank farther behind the clock ""i have never been so questioned ""
he cried i showed him that i knew his secret ""rome was not built in a day "" said
i ""he he "" he cried then as i turned away he put his head from behind
the clock-case and tapped his forehead with his forefinger so also did
the man with the shiny coat who stood before the empty fireplace having eaten the cold leg of pork--where is there a better dish save
only boiled mutton with capers --and having drunk both the tea and the
beer i told the company that such a meal had been called ""to box harry""
by the master who had observed it to be in great favour with commercial
gentlemen out of liverpool with this information and a stanza or two
from lopez de vega i left the inn of the rose and crown behind me having
first paid my reckoning at the door the landlord asked me for my name
and address ""and why "" i asked ""lest there should be inquiry for you "" said the landlord ""but why should they inquire for me ""
""ah who knows "" said the landlord musing and so i left him at the
door of the inn of the rose and crown whence came i observed a great
tumult of laughter ""assuredly "" thought i ""rome was not built in a
day ""
having walked down the main street of swinehurst which as i have
observed consists of half-timbered buildings in the ancient style i
came out upon the country road and proceeded to look for those wayside
adventures which are according to the master as thick as blackberries
for those who seek them upon an english highway i had already received
some boxing lessons before leaving london so it seemed to me that if i
should chance to meet some traveller whose size and age seemed such as to
encourage the venture i would ask him to strip off his coat and settle
any differences which we could find in the old english fashion i
waited therefore by a stile for any one who should chance to pass and
it was while i stood there that the screaming horror came upon me even
as it came upon the master in the dingle i gripped the bar of the
stile which was of good british oak oh who can tell the terrors of
the screaming horror that was what i thought as i grasped the oaken bar
of the stile was it the beer--or was it the tea or was it that the
landlord was right and that other the man with the black shiny coat he
who had answered the sign of the strange man in the corner but the
master drank tea with beer yes but the master also had the screaming
horror all this i thought as i grasped the bar of british oak which
was the top of the stile for half an hour the horror was upon me then
it passed and i was left feeling very weak and still grasping the oaken
bar i had not moved from the stile where i had been seized by the screaming
horror when i heard the sound of steps behind me and turning round i
perceived that a pathway led across the field upon the farther side of
the stile a woman was coming towards me along this pathway and it was
evident to me that she was one of those gipsy rias of whom the master
has said so much looking beyond her i could see the smoke of a fire
from a small dingle which showed where her tribe were camping the
woman herself was of a moderate height neither tall nor short with a
face which was much sunburned and freckled i must confess that she was
not beautiful but i do not think that anyone save the master has found
very beautiful women walking about upon the high-roads of england such
as she was i must make the best of her and well i knew how to address
her for many times had i admired the mixture of politeness and audacity
which should be used in such a case therefore when the woman had come
to the stile i held out my hand and helped her over ""what says the spanish poet calderon "" said i ""i doubt not that you
have read the couplet which has been thus englished:
 oh maiden may i humbly pray
 that i may help you on your way ""
the woman blushed but said nothing ""where "" i asked ""are the romany chals and the romany chis ""
she turned her head away and was silent ""though i am a gorgio "" said i ""i know something of the romany lil "" and
to prove it i sang the stanza--
 coliko coliko saulo wer
 apopli to the farming ker
 will wel and mang him mullo will wel and mang his truppo the girl laughed but said nothing it appeared to me from her
appearance that she might be one of those who make a living at telling
fortunes or ""dukkering "" as the master calls it at racecourses and other
gatherings of the sort ""do you dukker "" i asked she slapped me on the arm ""well you _are_ a pot of ginger "" said she i was pleased at the slap for it put me in mind of the peerless belle ""you can use long melford "" said i an expression which with the master meant fighting ""get along with your sauce "" said she and struck me again ""you are a very fine young woman "" said i ""and remind me of grunelda the daughter of hjalmar who stole the golden bowl from the king of the
islands ""
she seemed annoyed at this ""you keep a civil tongue young man "" said
she ""i meant no harm belle i was but comparing you to one of whom the saga
says her eyes were like the shine of sun upon icebergs ""
this seemed to please her for she smiled ""my name ain't belle "" she
said at last ""what is your name ""
""henrietta ""
""the name of a queen "" i said aloud ""go on "" said the girl ""of charles's queen "" said i ""of whom waller the poet (for the english
also have their poets though in this respect far inferior to the
basques)--of whom i say waller the poet said:
 that she was queen was the creator's act belated man could but endorse the fact ""
""i say "" cried the girl ""how you do go on ""
""so now "" said i ""since i have shown you that you are a queen you will
surely give me a choomer""--this being a kiss in romany talk ""i'll give you one on the ear-hole "" she cried ""then i will wrestle with you "" said i ""if you should chance to put me
down i will do penance by teaching you the armenian alphabet--the very
word alphabet as you will perceive shows us that our letters came from
greece if on the other hand i should chance to put you down you will
give me a choomer ""
i had got so far and she was climbing the stile with some pretence of
getting away from me when there came a van along the road belonging as
i discovered to a baker in swinehurst the horse which was of a brown
colour was such as is bred in the new forest being somewhat under
fifteen hands and of a hairy ill-kempt variety as i know less than the
master about horses i will say no more of this horse save to repeat
that its colour was brown--nor indeed had the horse or the horse's colour
anything to do with my narrative i might add however that it could
either be taken as a small horse or as a large pony being somewhat tall
for the one but undersized for the other i have now said enough about
this horse which has nothing to do with my story and i will turn my
attention to the driver this was a man with a broad florid face and brown side-whiskers he was
of a stout build and had rounded shoulders with a small mole of a
reddish colour over his left eyebrow his jacket was of velveteen and
he had large iron-shod boots which were perched upon the splashboard in
front of him he pulled up the van as he came up to the stile near which
i was standing with the maiden who had come from the dingle and in a
civil fashion he asked me if i could oblige him with a light for his
pipe then as i drew a matchbox from my pocket he threw his reins over
the splashboard and removing his large iron-shod boots he descended on
to the road he was a burly man but inclined to fat and scant of
breath it seemed to me that it was a chance for one of those wayside
boxing adventures which were so common in the olden times it was my
intention that i should fight the man and that the maiden from the
dingle standing by me should tell me when to use my right or my left as
the case might be picking me up also in case i should be so unfortunate
as to be knocked down by the man with the iron-shod boots and the small
mole of a reddish colour over his left eyebrow ""do you use long melford "" i asked he looked at me in some surprise and said that any mixture was good
enough for him ""by long melford "" said i ""i do not mean as you seem to think some
form of tobacco but i mean that art and science of boxing which was held
in such high esteem by our ancestors that some famous professors of it such as the great gully have been elected to the highest offices of the
state there were men of the highest character amongst the bruisers of
england of whom i would particularly mention tom of hereford better
known as tom spring though his father's name as i have been given to
understand was winter this however has nothing to do with the matter
in hand which is that you must fight me ""
the man with the florid face seemed very much surprised at my words so
that i cannot think that adventures of this sort were as common as i had
been led by the master to expect ""fight "" said he ""what about ""
""it is a good old english custom "" said i ""by which we may determine
which is the better man ""
""i've nothing against you "" said he ""nor i against you "" i answered ""so that we will fight for love which
was an expression much used in olden days it is narrated by harold
sygvynson that among the danes it was usual to do so even with battle-
axes as is told in his second set of runes therefore you will take off
your coat and fight "" as i spoke i stripped off my own the man's face was less florid than before ""i'm not going to fight ""
said he ""indeed you are "" i answered ""and this young woman will doubtless do you
the service to hold your coat ""
""you're clean balmy "" said henrietta ""besides "" said i ""if you will not fight me for love perhaps you will
fight me for this "" and i held out a sovereign ""will you hold his
coat "" i said to henrietta ""i'll hold the thick 'un "" said she ""no you don't "" said the man and put the sovereign into the pocket of
his trousers which were of a corduroy material ""now "" said he ""what
am i to do to earn this ""
""fight "" said i ""how do you do it "" he asked ""put up your hands "" i answered he put them up as i had said and stood there in a sheepish manner with
no idea of anything further it seemed to me that if i could make him
angry he would do better so i knocked off his hat which was black and
hard of the kind which is called billy-cock ""heh guv'nor "" he cried ""what are you up to ""
""that was to make you angry "" said i ""well i am angry "" said he ""then here is your hat "" said i ""and afterwards we shall fight ""
i turned as i spoke to pick up his hat which had rolled behind where i
was standing as i stooped to reach it i received such a blow that i
could neither rise erect nor yet sit down this blow which i received as
i stooped for his billy-cock hat was not from his fist but from his iron-
shod boot the same which i had observed upon the splashboard being
unable either to rise erect or yet to sit down i leaned upon the oaken
bar of the stile and groaned loudly on account of the pain of the blow
which i had received even the screaming horror had given me less pain
than this blow from the iron-shod boot when at last i was able to stand
erect i found that the florid-faced man had driven away with his cart which could no longer be seen the maiden from the dingle was standing
at the other side of the stile and a ragged man was running across the
field from the direction of the fire ""why did you not warn me henrietta "" i asked ""i hadn't time "" said she ""why were you such a chump as to turn your
back on him like that ""
the ragged man had reached us where i stood talking to henrietta by the
stile i will not try to write his conversation as he said it because i
have observed that the master never condescends to dialect but prefers
by a word introduced here and there to show the fashion of a man's
speech i will only say that the man from the dingle spoke as did the
anglo-saxons who were wont as is clearly shown by the venerable bede to call their leaders 'enjist and 'orsa two words which in their proper
meaning signify a horse and a mare ""what did he hit you for "" asked the man from the dingle he was
exceedingly ragged with a powerful frame a lean brown face and an
oaken cudgel in his hand his voice was very hoarse and rough as is the
case with those who live in the open air ""the bloke hit you "" said he ""what did the bloke hit you for ""
""he asked him to "" said henrietta ""asked him to--asked him what ""
""why he asked him to hit him gave him a thick 'un to do it ""
the ragged man seemed surprised ""see here gov'nor "" said he ""if
you're collectin' i could let you have one half-price ""
""he took me unawares "" said i ""what else would the bloke do when you bashed his hat "" said the maiden
from the dingle by this time i was able to straighten myself up by the aid of the oaken
bar which formed the top of the stile having quoted a few lines of the
chinese poet lo-tun-an to the effect that however hard a knock might be it might always conceivably be harder i looked about for my coat but
could by no means find it ""henrietta "" i said ""what have you done with my coat ""
""look here gov'nor "" said the man from the dingle ""not so much
henrietta if it's the same to you this woman's my wife who are you
to call her henrietta ""
i assured the man from the dingle that i had meant no disrespect to his
wife ""i had thought she was a mort "" said i; ""but the ria of a romany
chal is always sacred to me ""
""clean balmy "" said the woman ""some other day "" said i ""i may visit you in your camp in the dingle and
read you the master's book about the romanys ""
""what's romanys "" asked the man _myself_ romanys are gipsies _the man_ we ain't gipsies _myself_ what are you then _the man_ we are hoppers _myself_ (to henrietta) then how did you understand all i have said to
you about gipsies _henrietta_ i didn't i again asked for my coat but it was clear now that before offering to
fight the florid-faced man with the mole over his left eyebrow i must
have hung my coat upon the splashboard of his van i therefore recited a
verse from ferideddin-atar the persian poet which signifies that it is
more important to preserve your skin than your clothes and bidding
farewell to the man from the dingle and his wife i returned into the old
english village of swinehurst where i was able to buy a second-hand
coat which enabled me to make my way to the station where i should
start for london i could not but remark with some surprise that i was
followed to the station by many of the villagers together with the man
with the shiny coat and that other the strange man he who had slunk
behind the clock-case from time to time i turned and approached them hoping to fall into conversation with them; but as i did so they would
break and hasten down the road only the village constable came on and
he walked by my side and listened while i told him the history of hunyadi
janos and the events which occurred during the wars between that hero known also as corvinus or the crow-like and mahommed the second he who
captured constantinople better known as byzantium before the christian
epoch together with the constable i entered the station and seating
myself in a carriage i took paper from my pocket and i began to write
upon the paper all that had occurred to me in order that i might show
that it was not easy in these days to follow the example of the master as i wrote i heard the constable talk to the station-master a stout middle-sized man with a red neck-tie and tell him of my own adventures
in the old english village of swinehurst ""he is a gentleman too "" said the constable ""and i doubt not that he
lives in a big house in london town ""
""a very big house if every man had his rights "" said the station-master and waving his hand he signalled that the train should proceed "
Chapter 7,"vii the surgeon of gaster fell
i--how the woman came to kirkby-malhouse
bleak and wind-swept is the little town of kirkby-malhouse harsh and
forbidding are the fells upon which it stands it stretches in a single
line of grey-stone slate-roofed houses dotted down the furze-clad slope
of the rolling moor in this lonely and secluded village i james upperton found myself in
the summer of '85 little as the hamlet had to offer it contained that
for which i yearned above all things--seclusion and freedom from all
which might distract my mind from the high and weighty subjects which
engaged it but the inquisitiveness of my landlady made my lodgings
undesirable and i determined to seek new quarters as it chanced i had in one of my rambles come upon an isolated dwelling
in the very heart of these lonely moors which i at once determined
should be my own it was a two-roomed cottage which had once belonged
to some shepherd but had long been deserted and was crumbling rapidly
to ruin in the winter floods the gaster beck which runs down gaster
fell where the little dwelling stood had overswept its banks and torn
away a part of the wall the roof was in ill case and the scattered
slates lay thick amongst the grass yet the main shell of the house
stood firm and true; and it was no great task for me to have all that was
amiss set right the two rooms i laid out in a widely different manner--my own tastes are
of a spartan turn and the outer chamber was so planned as to accord with
them an oil-stove by rippingille of birmingham furnished me with the
means of cooking; while two great bags the one of flour and the other
of potatoes made me independent of all supplies from without in diet i
had long been a pythagorean so that the scraggy long-limbed sheep which
browsed upon the wiry grass by the gaster beck had little to fear from
their new companion a nine-gallon cask of oil served me as a sideboard;
while a square table a deal chair and a truckle-bed completed the list
of my domestic fittings at the head of my couch hung two unpainted
shelves--the lower for my dishes and cooking utensils the upper for the
few portraits which took me back to the little that was pleasant in the
long wearisome toiling for wealth and for pleasure which had marked the
life i had left behind if this dwelling-room of mine were plain even to squalor its poverty was
more than atoned for by the luxury of the chamber which was destined to
serve me as my study i had ever held that it was best for my mind to be
surrounded by such objects as would be in harmony with the studies which
occupied it and that the loftiest and most ethereal conditions of
thought are only possible amid surroundings which please the eye and
gratify the senses the room which i had set apart for my mystic studies
was set forth in a style as gloomy and majestic as the thoughts and
aspirations with which it was to harmonise both walls and ceilings were
covered with a paper of the richest and glossiest black on which was
traced a lurid and arabesque pattern of dead gold a black velvet
curtain covered the single diamond-paned window; while a thick yielding
carpet of the same material prevented the sound of my own footfalls as i
paced backward and forward from breaking the current of my thought along the cornices ran gold rods from which depended six pictures all
of the sombre and imaginative caste which chimed best with my fancy and yet it was destined that ere ever i reached this quiet harbour i
should learn that i was still one of humankind and that it is an ill
thing to strive to break the bond which binds us to our fellows it was
but two nights before the date i had fixed upon for my change of
dwelling when i was conscious of a bustle in the house beneath with the
bearing of heavy burdens up the creaking stair and the harsh voice of my
landlady loud in welcome and protestations of joy from time to time amid the whirl of words i could hear a gentle and softly modulated
voice which struck pleasantly upon my ear after the long weeks during
which i had listened only to the rude dialect of the dalesmen for an
hour i could hear the dialogue beneath--the high voice and the low with
clatter of cup and clink of spoon until at last a light quick step
passed my study door and i knew that my new fellow lodger had sought her
room on the morning after this incident i was up betimes as is my wont; but i
was surprised on glancing from my window to see that our new inmate was
earlier still she was walking down the narrow pathway which zigzags
over the fell--a tall woman slender her head sunk upon her breast her
arms filled with a bristle of wild flowers which she had gathered in her
morning rambles the white and pink of her dress and the touch of deep
red ribbon in her broad drooping hat formed a pleasant dash of colour
against the dun-tinted landscape she was some distance off when i first
set eyes upon her yet i knew that this wandering woman could be none
other than our arrival of last night for there was a grace and
refinement in her bearing which marked her from the dwellers of the
fells even as i watched she passed swiftly and lightly down the
pathway and turning through the wicket gate at the further end of our
cottage garden she seated herself upon the green bank which faced my
window and strewing her flowers in front of her set herself to arrange
them as she sat there with the rising sun at her back and the glow of the
morning spreading like an aureole around her stately and well-poised
head i could see that she was a woman of extraordinary personal beauty her face was spanish rather than english in its type--oval olive with
black sparkling eyes and a sweetly sensitive mouth from under the
broad straw hat two thick coils of blue-black hair curved down on either
side of her graceful queenly neck i was surprised as i watched her to see that her shoes and skirt bore witness to a journey rather than to
a mere morning ramble her light dress was stained wet and bedraggled;
while her boots were thick with the yellow soil of the fells her face too wore a weary expression and her young beauty seemed to be clouded
over by the shadow of inward trouble even as i watched her she burst
suddenly into wild weeping and throwing down her bundle of flowers ran
swiftly into the house distrait as i was and weary of the ways of the world i was conscious of
a sudden pang of sympathy and grief as i looked upon the spasm of despair
which seemed to convulse this strange and beautiful woman i bent to my
books and yet my thoughts would ever turn to her proud clear-cut face her weather-stained dress her drooping head and the sorrow which lay in
each line and feature of her pensive face mrs adams my landlady was wont to carry up my frugal breakfast; yet it
was very rarely that i allowed her to break the current of my thoughts or to draw my mind by her idle chatter from weightier things this
morning however for once she found me in a listening mood and with
little prompting proceeded to pour into my ears all that she knew of our
beautiful visitor ""miss eva cameron be her name sir "" she said: ""but who she be or where
she came fra i know little more than yoursel' maybe it was the same
reason that brought her to kirkby-malhouse as fetched you there yoursel' sir ""
""possibly "" said i ignoring the covert question; ""but i should hardly
have thought that kirkby-malhouse was a place which offered any great
attractions to a young lady ""
""heh sir "" she cried ""there's the wonder of it the leddy has just
come fra france; and how her folk come to learn of me is just a wonder a
week ago up comes a man to my door--a fine man sir and a gentleman as
one could see with half an eye 'you are mrs adams ' says he 'i
engage your rooms for miss cameron ' says he 'she will be here in a
week ' says he; and then off without a word of terms last night there
comes the young leddy hersel'--soft-spoken and downcast with a touch of
the french in her speech but my sakes sir i must away and mak' her
some tea for she'll feel lonesome-like poor lamb when she wakes under
a strange roof ""
ii--how i went forth to gaster fell
i was still engaged upon my breakfast when i heard the clatter of dishes
and the landlady's footfall as she passed toward her new lodger's room an instant afterward she had rushed down the passage and burst in upon me
with uplifted hand and startled eyes ""lord 'a mercy sir "" she cried ""and asking your pardon for troubling you but i'm feared o' the young
leddy sir; she is not in her room ""
""why there she is "" said i standing up and glancing through the
casement ""she has gone back for the flowers she left upon the bank ""
""oh sir see her boots and her dress "" cried the landlady wildly ""i
wish her mother was here sir--i do where she has been is more than i
ken but her bed has not been lain on this night ""
""she has felt restless doubtless and went for a walk though the hour
was certainly a strange one ""
mrs adams pursed her lip and shook her head but then as she stood at
the casement the girl beneath looked smilingly up at her and beckoned to
her with a merry gesture to open the window ""have you my tea there "" she asked in a rich clear voice with a touch
of the mincing french accent ""it is in your room miss ""
""look at my boots mrs adams "" she cried thrusting them out from under
her skirt ""these fells of yours are dreadful places--effroyable--one
inch two inch; never have i seen such mud my dress too--_voila_ ""
""eh miss but you are in a pickle "" cried the landlady as she gazed
down at the bedraggled gown ""but you must be main weary and heavy for
sleep ""
""no no "" she answered laughingly ""i care not for sleep what is
sleep it is a little death--_voila tout_ but for me to walk to run to beathe the air--that is to live i was not tired and so all night i
have explored these fells of yorkshire ""
""lord 'a mercy miss and where did you go "" asked mrs adams she waved her hand round in a sweeping gesture which included the whole
western horizon ""there "" she cried ""o comme elles sont tristes et
sauvages ces collines but i have flowers here you will give me
water will you not they will wither else "" she gathered her treasures
in her lap and a moment later we heard her light springy footfall upon
the stair so she had been out all night this strange woman what motive could
have taken her from her snug room on to the bleak wind-swept hills could it be merely the restlessness the love of adventure of a young
girl or was there possibly some deeper meaning in this nocturnal
journey deep as were the mysteries which my studies had taught me to solve here
was a human problem which for the moment at least was beyond my
comprehension i had walked out on the moor in the forenoon and on my
return as i topped the brow that overlooks the little town i saw my
fellow-lodger some little distance off among the gorse she had raised a
light easel in front of her and with papered board laid across it was
preparing to paint the magnificent landscape of rock and moor which
stretched away in front of her as i watched her i saw that she was
looking anxiously to right and left close by me a pool of water had
formed in a hollow dipping the cup of my pocket-flask into it i
carried it across to her ""miss cameron i believe "" said i ""i am your fellow-lodger upperton
is my name we must introduce ourselves in these wilds if we are not to
be for ever strangers ""
""oh then you live also with mrs adams "" she cried ""i had thought
that there were none but peasants in this strange place ""
""i am a visitor like yourself "" i answered ""i am a student and have
come for quiet and repose which my studies demand ""
""quiet indeed "" said she glancing round at the vast circle of silent
moors with the one tiny line of grey cottages which sloped down beneath
us ""and yet not quiet enough "" i answered laughing ""for i have been forced
to move further into the fells for the absolute peace which i require ""
""have you then built a house upon the fells "" she asked arching her
eyebrows ""i have and hope within a few days to occupy it ""
""ah but that is _triste_ "" she cried ""and where is it then this
house which you have built ""
""it is over yonder "" i answered ""see that stream which lies like a
silver band upon the distant moor it is the gaster beck and it runs
through gaster fell ""
she started and turned upon me her great dark questioning eyes with a
look in which surprise incredulity and something akin to horror seemed
to be struggling for mastery ""and you will live on the gaster fell "" she cried ""so i have planned but what do you know of gaster fell miss cameron ""
i asked ""i had thought that you were a stranger in these parts ""
""indeed i have never been here before "" she answered ""but i have heard
my brother talk of these yorkshire moors; and if i mistake not i have
heard him name this very one as the wildest and most savage of them all ""
""very likely "" said i carelessly ""it is indeed a dreary place ""
""then why live there "" she cried eagerly ""consider the loneliness the
barrenness the want of all comfort and of all aid should aid be
needed ""
""aid what aid should be needed on gaster fell ""
she looked down and shrugged her shoulders ""sickness may come in all
places "" said she ""if i were a man i do not think i would live alone on
gaster fell ""
""i have braved worse dangers than that "" said i laughing; ""but i fear
that your picture will be spoiled for the clouds are banking up and
already i feel a few raindrops ""
indeed it was high time we were on our way to shelter for even as i
spoke there came the sudden steady swish of the shower laughing
merrily my companion threw her light shawl over her head and seizing
picture and easel ran with the lithe grace of a young fawn down the
furze-clad slope while i followed after with camp-stool and paint-box * * * * *
it was the eve of my departure from kirkby-malhouse that we sat upon the
green bank in the garden she with dark dreamy eyes looking sadly out
over the sombre fells; while i with a book upon my knee glanced
covertly at her lovely profile and marvelled to myself how twenty years
of life could have stamped so sad and wistful an expression upon it ""you have read much "" i remarked at last ""women have opportunities now
such as their mothers never knew have you ever thought of going
further--or seeking a course of college or even a learned profession ""
she smiled wearily at the thought ""i have no aim no ambition "" she said ""my future is black--confused--a
chaos my life is like to one of these paths upon the fells you have
seen them monsieur upperton they are smooth and straight and clear
where they begin; but soon they wind to left and wind to right and so
mid rocks and crags until they lose themselves in some quagmire at
brussels my path was straight; but now _mon dieu_ who is there can tell
me where it leads ""
""it might take no prophet to do that miss cameron "" quoth i with the
fatherly manner which twoscore years may show toward one ""if i may read
your life i would venture to say that you were destined to fulfil the
lot of women--to make some good man happy and to shed around in some
wider circle the pleasure which your society has given me since first i
knew you ""
""i will never marry "" said she with a sharp decision which surprised
and somewhat amused me ""not marry--and why ""
a strange look passed over her sensitive features and she plucked
nervously at the grass on the bank beside her ""i dare not "" said she in a voice that quivered with emotion ""dare not ""
""it is not for me i have other things to do that path of which i
spoke is one which i must tread alone ""
""but this is morbid "" said i ""why should your lot miss cameron be
separate from that of my own sisters or the thousand other young ladies
whom every season brings out into the world but perhaps it is that you
have a fear and distrust of mankind marriage brings a risk as well as a
happiness ""
""the risk would be with the man who married me "" she cried and then in
an instant as though she had said too much she sprang to her feet and
drew her mantle round her ""the night air is chill mr upperton "" said
she and so swept swiftly away leaving me to muse over the strange words
which had fallen from her lips clearly it was time that i should go i set my teeth and vowed that
another day should not have passed before i should have snapped this
newly formed tie and sought the lonely retreat which awaited me upon the
moors breakfast was hardly over in the morning before a peasant dragged
up to the door the rude hand-cart which was to convey my few personal
belongings to my new dwelling my fellow-lodger had kept her room; and steeled as my mind was against her influence i was yet conscious of a
little throb of disappointment that she should allow me to depart without
a word of farewell my hand-cart with its load of books had already
started and i having shaken hands with mrs adams was about to follow
it when there was a quick scurry of feet on the stair and there she was
beside me all panting with her own haste ""then you go--you really go "" said she ""my studies call me ""
""and to gaster fell "" she asked ""yes; to the cottage which i have built there ""
""and you will live alone there ""
""with my hundred companions who lie in that cart ""
""ah books "" she cried with a pretty shrug of her graceful shoulders ""but you will make me a promise ""
""what is it "" i asked in surprise ""it is a small thing you will not refuse me ""
""you have but to ask it ""
she bent forward her beautiful face with an expression of the most
intense earnestness ""you will bolt your door at night "" said she; and
was gone ere i could say a word in answer to her extraordinary request it was a strange thing for me to find myself at last duly installed in my
lonely dwelling for me now the horizon was bounded by the barren
circle of wiry unprofitable grass patched over with furze bushes and
scarred by the profusion of nature's gaunt and granite ribs a duller wearier waste i have never seen; but its dullness was its very charm and yet the very first night which i spent at gaster fell there came a
strange incident to lead my thoughts back once more to the world which i
had left behind me it had been a sullen and sultry evening with great livid cloud-banks
mustering in the west as the night wore on the air within my little
cabin became closer and more oppressive a weight seemed to rest upon my
brow and my chest from far away the low rumble of thunder came moaning
over the moor unable to sleep i dressed and standing at my cottage
door looked on the black solitude which surrounded me taking the narrow sheep path which ran by this stream i strolled along
it for some hundred yards and had turned to retrace my steps when the
moon was finally buried beneath an ink-black cloud and the darkness
deepened so suddenly that i could see neither the path at my feet the
stream upon my right nor the rocks upon my left i was standing groping
about in the thick gloom when there came a crash of thunder with a flash
of lightning which lighted up the whole vast fell so that every bush and
rock stood out clear and hard in the vivid light it was but for an
instant and yet that momentary view struck a thrill of fear and
astonishment through me for in my very path not twenty yards before me there stood a woman the livid light beating upon her face and showing up
every detail of her dress and features there was no mistaking those dark eyes that tall graceful figure it
was she--eva cameron the woman whom i thought i had for ever left for
an instant i stood petrified marvelling whether this could indeed be
she or whether it was some figment conjured up by my excited brain then
i ran swiftly forward in the direction where i had seen her calling
loudly upon her but without reply again i called and again no answer
came back save the melancholy wail of the owl a second flash
illuminated the landscape and the moon burst out from behind its cloud but i could not though i climbed upon a knoll which overlooked the whole
moor see any sign of this strange midnight wanderer for an hour or
more i traversed the fell and at last found myself back at my little
cabin still uncertain as to whether it had been a woman or a shadow upon
which i gazed iii--of the grey cottage in the glen
it was either on the fourth or the fifth day after i had taken possession
of my cottage that i was astonished to hear footsteps upon the grass
outside quickly followed by a crack as from a stick upon the door the
explosion of an infernal machine would hardly have surprised or
discomfited me more i had hoped to have shaken off all intrusion for
ever yet here was somebody beating at my door with as little ceremony as
if it had been a village ale-house hot with anger i flung down my book
and withdrew the bolt just as my visitor had raised his stick to renew
his rough application for admittance he was a tall powerful man tawny-
bearded and deep-chested clad in a loose-fitting suit of tweed cut for
comfort rather than elegance as he stood in the shimmering sunlight i
took in every feature of his face the large fleshy nose; the steady
blue eyes with their thick thatch of overhanging brows; the broad
forehead all knitted and lined with furrows which were strangely at
variance with his youthful bearing in spite of his weather-stained felt
hat and the coloured handkerchief slung round his muscular brown neck i
could see at a glance he was a man of breeding and education i had been
prepared for some wandering shepherd or uncouth tramp but this
apparition fairly disconcerted me ""you look astonished "" said he with a smile ""did you think then that
you were the only man in the world with a taste for solitude you see
that there are other hermits in the wilderness besides yourself ""
""do you mean to say that you live here "" i asked in no conciliatory
voice ""up yonder "" he answered tossing his head backward ""i thought as we
were neighbours mr upperton that i could not do less than look in and
see if i could assist you in any way ""
""thank you "" i said coldly standing with my hand upon the latch of the
door ""i am a man of simple tastes and you can do nothing for me you
have the advantage of me in knowing my name ""
he appeared to be chilled by my ungracious manner ""i learned it from the masons who were at work here "" he said ""as for
me i am a surgeon the surgeon of gaster fell that is the name i have
gone by in these parts and it serves as well as another ""
""not much room for practice here "" i observed ""not a soul except yourself for miles on either side ""
""you appear to have had need of some assistance yourself "" i remarked glancing at a broad white splash as from the recent action of some
powerful acid upon his sunburnt cheek ""that is nothing "" he answered curtly turning his face half round to
hide the mark ""i must get back for i have a companion who is waiting
for me if i can ever do anything for you pray let me know you have
only to follow the beck upward for a mile or so to find my place have
you a bolt on the inside of your door ""
""yes "" i answered rather startled at this question ""keep it bolted then "" he said ""the fell is a strange place you
never know who may be about it is as well to be on the safe side goodbye "" he raised his hat turned on his heel and lounged away along
the bank of the little stream i was still standing with my hand upon the latch gazing after my
unexpected visitor when i became aware of yet another dweller in the
wilderness some distance along the path which the stranger was taking
there lay a great grey boulder and leaning against this was a small wizened man who stood erect as the other approached and advanced to
meet him the two talked for a minute or more the taller man nodding
his head frequently in my direction as though describing what had passed
between us then they walked on together and disappeared in a dip of
the fell presently i saw them ascending once more some rising ground
farther on my acquaintance had thrown his arm round his elderly friend either from affection or from a desire to aid him up the steep incline the square burly figure and its shrivelled meagre companion stood out
against the sky-line and turning their faces they looked back at me at
the sight i slammed the door lest they should be encouraged to return but when i peeped from the window some minutes afterward i perceived
that they were gone all day i bent over the egyptian papyrus upon which i was engaged; but
neither the subtle reasonings of the ancient philosopher of memphis nor
the mystic meaning which lay in his pages could raise my mind from the
things of earth evening was drawing in before i threw my work aside in
despair my heart was bitter against this man for his intrusion standing by the beck which purled past the door of my cabin i cooled my
heated brow and thought the matter over clearly it was the small
mystery hanging over these neighbours of mine which had caused my mind to
run so persistently on them that cleared up they would no longer cause
an obstacle to my studies what was to hinder me then from walking in
the direction of their dwelling and observing for myself without
permitting them to suspect my presence what manner of men they might be doubtless their mode of life would be found to admit of some simple and
prosaic explanation in any case the evening was fine and a walk would
be bracing for mind and body lighting my pipe i set off over the moors
in the direction which they had taken about half-way down a wild glen there stood a small clump of gnarled and
stunted oak trees from behind these a thin dark column of smoke rose
into the still evening air clearly this marked the position of my
neighbour's house trending away to the left i was able to gain the
shelter of a line of rocks and so reach a spot from which i could
command a view of the building without exposing myself to any risk of
being observed it was a small slate-covered cottage hardly larger
than the boulders among which it lay like my own cabin it showed signs
of having been constructed for the use of some shepherd; but unlike
mine no pains had been taken by the tenants to improve and enlarge it two little peeping windows a cracked and weather-beaten door and a
discoloured barrel for catching the rain water were the only external
objects from which i might draw deductions as to the dwellers within yet
even in these there was food for thought for as i drew nearer still
concealing myself behind the ridge i saw that thick bars of iron covered
the windows while the old door was slashed and plated with the same
metal these strange precautions together with the wild surroundings
and unbroken solitude gave an indescribably ill omen and fearsome
character to the solitary building thrusting my pipe into my pocket i
crawled upon my hands and knees through the gorse and ferns until i was
within a hundred yards of my neighbour's door there finding that i
could not approach nearer without fear of detection i crouched down and
set myself to watch i had hardly settled into my hiding place when the door of the cottage
swung open and the man who had introduced himself to me as the surgeon
of gaster fell came out bareheaded with a spade in his hands in front
of the door there was a small cultivated patch containing potatoes peas
and other forms of green stuff and here he proceeded to busy himself trimming weeding and arranging singing the while in a powerful though
not very musical voice he was all engrossed in his work with his back
to the cottage when there emerged from the half-open door the same
attenuated creature whom i had seen in the morning i could perceive now
that he was a man of sixty wrinkled bent and feeble with sparse grizzled hair and long colourless face with a cringing sidelong
gait he shuffled toward his companion who was unconscious of his
approach until he was close upon him his light footfall or his
breathing may have finally given notice of his proximity for the worker
sprang round and faced him each made a quick step toward the other as
though in greeting and then--even now i feel the horror of the
instant--the tall man rushed upon and knocked his companion to the earth then whipping up his body ran with great speed over the intervening
ground and disappeared with his burden into the house case hardened as i was by my varied life the suddenness and violence of
the thing made me shudder the man's age his feeble frame his humble
and deprecating manner all cried shame against the deed so hot was my
anger that i was on the point of striding up to the cabin unarmed as i
was when the sound of voices from within showed me that the victim had
recovered the sun had sunk beneath the horizon and all was grey save
a red feather in the cap of pennigent secure in the failing light i
approached near and strained my ears to catch what was passing i could
hear the high querulous voice of the elder man and the deep rough
monotone of his assailant mixed with a strange metallic jangling and
clanking presently the surgeon came out locked the door behind him and
stamped up and down in the twilight pulling at his hair and brandishing
his arms like a man demented then he set off walking rapidly up the
valley and i soon lost sight of him among the rocks when his footsteps had died away in the distance i drew nearer to the
cottage the prisoner within was still pouring forth a stream of words and moaning from time to time like a man in pain these words resolved
themselves as i approached into prayers--shrill voluble prayers pattered forth with the intense earnestness of one who sees impending an
imminent danger there was to me something inexpressibly awesome in this
gush of solemn entreaty from the lonely sufferer meant for no human ear and jarring upon the silence of the night i was still pondering whether
i should mix myself in the affair or not when i heard in the distance
the sound of the surgeon's returning footfall at that i drew myself up
quickly by the iron bars and glanced in through the diamond-paned window the interior of the cottage was lighted up by a lurid glow coming from
what i afterward discovered to be a chemical furnace by its rich light
i could distinguish a great litter of retorts test tubes and condensers which sparkled over the table and threw strange grotesque shadows on
the wall on the further side of the room was a wooden framework
resembling a hencoop and in this still absorbed in prayer knelt the
man whose voice i heard the red glow beating upon his upturned face
made it stand out from the shadow like a painting from rembrandt showing
up every wrinkle upon the parchment-like skin i had but time for a
fleeting glance; then dropping from the window i made off through the
rocks and the heather nor slackened my pace until i found myself back in
my cabin once more there i threw myself upon my couch more disturbed
and shaken than i had ever thought to feel again such doubts as i might have had as to whether i had indeed seen my former
fellow-lodger upon the night of the thunderstorm were resolved the next
morning strolling along down the path which led to the fell i saw in
one spot where the ground was soft the impressions of a foot--the small dainty foot of a well-booted woman that tiny heel and high instep could
have belonged to none other than my companion of kirkby-malhouse i
followed her trail for some distance till it still pointed as far as i
could discern it to the lonely and ill-omened cottage what power could
there be to draw this tender girl through wind and rain and darkness across the fearsome moors to that strange rendezvous i have said that a little beck flowed down the valley and past my very
door a week or so after the doings which i have described i was seated
by my window when i perceived something white drifting slowly down the
stream my first thought was that it was a drowning sheep; but picking
up my stick i strolled to the bank and hooked it ashore on examination
it proved to be a large sheet torn and tattered with the initials j c in the corner what gave it its sinister significance however was that
from hem to hem it was all dabbled and discoloured shutting the door of my cabin i set off up the glen in the direction of
the surgeon's cabin i had not gone far before i perceived the very man
himself he was walking rapidly along the hillside beating the furze
bushes with a cudgel and bellowing like a madman indeed at the sight
of him the doubts as to his sanity which had arisen in my mind were
strengthened and confirmed as he approached i noticed that his left arm was suspended in a sling on
perceiving me he stood irresolute as though uncertain whether to come
over to me or not i had no desire for an interview with him however so i hurried past him on which he continued on his way still shouting
and striking about with his club when he had disappeared over the
fells i made my way down to his cottage determined to find some clue to
what had occurred i was surprised on reaching it to find the iron-
plated door flung wide open the ground immediately outside it was
marked with the signs of a struggle the chemical apparatus within and
the furniture were all dashed about and shattered most suggestive of
all the sinister wooden cage was stained with blood-marks and its
unfortunate occupant had disappeared my heart was heavy for the little
man for i was assured i should never see him in this world more there was nothing in the cabin to throw any light upon the identity of my
neighbours the room was stuffed with chemical instruments in one
corner a small bookcase contained a choice selection of works of science in another was a pile of geological specimens collected from the
limestone i caught no glimpse of the surgeon upon my homeward journey; but when i
reached my cottage i was astonished and indignant to find that somebody
had entered it in my absence boxes had been pulled out from under the
bed the curtains disarranged the chairs drawn out from the wall even
my study had not been safe from this rough intruder for the prints of a
heavy boot were plainly visible on the ebony-black carpet iv--of the man who came in the night
the night set in gusty and tempestuous and the moon was all girt with
ragged clouds the wind blew in melancholy gusts sobbing and sighing
over the moor and setting all the gorse bushes agroaning from time to
time a little sputter of rain pattered up against the window-pane i sat
until near midnight glancing over the fragment on immortality by
iamblichus the alexandrian platonist of whom the emperor julian said
that he was posterior to plato in time but not in genius at last shutting up my book i opened my door and took a last look at the dreary
fell and still more dreary sky as i protruded my head a swoop of wind
caught me and sent the red ashes of my pipe sparkling and dancing through
the darkness at the same moment the moon shone brilliantly out from
between two clouds and i saw sitting on the hillside not two hundred
yards from my door the man who called himself the surgeon of gaster
fell he was squatted among the heather his elbows upon his knees and
his chin resting upon his hands as motionless as a stone with his gaze
fixed steadily upon the door of my dwelling at the sight of this ill-omened sentinel a chill of horror and of fear
shot through me for his gloomy and mysterious associations had cast a
glamour round the man and the hour and place were in keeping with his
sinister presence in a moment however a manly glow of resentment and
self-confidence drove this petty emotion from my mind and i strode
fearlessly in his direction he rose as i approached and faced me with
the moon shining on his grave bearded face and glittering on his
eyeballs ""what is the meaning of this "" i cried as i came upon him ""what right have you to play the spy on me ""
i could see the flush of anger rise on his face ""your stay in the
country has made you forget your manners "" he said ""the moor is free to
all ""
""you will say next that my house is free to all "" i said hotly ""you
have had the impertience to ransack it in my absence this afternoon ""
he started and his features showed the most intense excitement ""i
swear to you that i had no hand in it "" he cried ""i have never set foot
in your house in my life oh sir sir if you will but believe me there is a danger hanging over you and you would do well to be careful ""
""i have had enough of you "" i said ""i saw that cowardly blow you struck
when you thought no human eye rested upon you i have been to your
cottage too and know all that it has to tell if there is a law in
england you shall hang for what you have done as to me i am an old
soldier sir and i am armed i shall not fasten my door but if you or
any other villain attempt to cross my threshold it shall be at your own
risk "" with these words i swung round upon my heel and strode into my
cabin for two days the wind freshened and increased with constant squalls of
rain until on the third night the most furious storm was raging which i
can ever recollect in england i felt that it was positively useless to
go to bed nor could i concentrate my mind sufficiently to read a book i
turned my lamp half down to moderate the glare and leaning back in my
chair i gave myself up to reverie i must have lost all perception of
time for i have no recollection how long i sat there on the borderland
betwixt thought and slumber at last about 3 or possibly 4 o'clock i
came to myself with a start--not only came to myself but with every
sense and nerve upon the strain looking round my chamber in the dim
light i could not see anything to justify my sudden trepidation the
homely room the rain-blurred window and the rude wooden door were all as
they had been i had begun to persuade myself that some half-formed
dream had sent that vague thrill through my nerves when in a moment i
became conscious of what it was it was a sound--the sound of a human
step outside my solitary cottage amid the thunder and the rain and the wind i could hear it--a dull stealthy footfall now on the grass now on the stones--occasionally
stopping entirely then resumed and ever drawing nearer i sat
breathlessly listening to the eerie sound it had stopped now at my
very door and was replaced by a panting and gasping as of one who has
travelled fast and far by the flickering light of the expiring lamp i could see that the latch
of my door was twitching as though a gentle pressure was exerted on it
from without slowly slowly it rose until it was free of the catch and then there was a pause of a quarter minute or more while i still eat
silent with dilated eyes and drawn sabre then very slowly the door
began to revolve upon its hinges and the keen air of the night came
whistling through the slit very cautiously it was pushed open so that
never a sound came from the rusty hinges as the aperture enlarged i
became aware of a dark shadowy figure upon my threshold and of a pale
face that looked in at me the features were human but the eyes were
not they seemed to burn through the darkness with a greenish brilliancy
of their own; and in their baleful shifty glare i was conscious of the
very spirit of murder springing from my chair i had raised my naked
sword when with a wild shouting a second figure dashed up to my door at its approach my shadowy visitant uttered a shrill cry and fled away
across the fells yelping like a beaten hound tingling with my recent fear i stood at my door peering through the
night with the discordant cry of the fugitives still ringing in my ears at that moment a vivid flash of lightning illuminated the whole landscape
and made it as clear as day by its light i saw far away upon the
hillside two dark figures pursuing each other with extreme rapidity
across the fells even at that distance the contrast between them forbid
all doubt as to their identity the first was the small elderly man whom i had supposed to be dead; the second was my neighbour the surgeon for an instant they stood out clear and hard in the unearthly light; in
the next the darkness had closed over them and they were gone as i
turned to re-enter my chamber my foot rattled against something on my
threshold stooping i found it was a straight knife fashioned entirely
of lead and so soft and brittle that it was a strange choice for a
weapon to render it more harmless the top had been cut square off the
edge however had been assiduously sharpened against a stone as was
evident from the markings upon it so that it was still a dangerous
implement in the grasp of a determined man and what was the meaning of it all you ask many a drama which i have
come across in my wandering life some as strange and as striking as this
one has lacked the ultimate explanation which you demand fate is a
grand weaver of tales; but she ends them as a rule in defiance of all
artistic laws and with an unbecoming want of regard for literary
propriety as it happens however i have a letter before me as i write
which i may add without comment and which will clear all that may remain
dark ""kirkby lunatic asylum ""_september_ 4_th_ 1885 ""sir --i am deeply conscious that some apology and explanation is due
 to you for the very startling and in your eyes mysterious events
 which have recently occurred and which have so seriously interfered
 with the retired existence which you desire to lead i should have
 called upon you on the morning after the recapture of my father but
 my knowledge of your dislike to visitors and also of--you will excuse
 my saying it--your very violent temper led me to think that it was
 better to communicate with you by letter ""my poor father was a hard-working general practitioner in birmingham where his name is still remembered and respected about ten years ago
 he began to show signs of mental aberration which we were inclined to
 put down to overwork and the effects of a sunstroke feeling my own
 incompetence to pronounce upon a case of such importance i at once
 sought the highest advice in birmingham and london among others we
 consulted the eminent alienist mr fraser brown who pronounced my
 father's case to be intermittent in its nature but dangerous during
 the paroxysms 'it may take a homicidal or it may take a religious
 turn ' he said; 'or it may prove to be a mixture of both for months
 he may be as well as you or me and then in a moment he may break out you will incur a great responsibility if you leave him without
 supervision '
 ""i need say no more sir you will understand the terrible task which
 has fallen upon my poor sister and me in endeavouring to save my
 father from the asylum which in his sane moments filled him with
 horror i can only regret that your peace has been disturbed by our
 misfortunes and i offer you in my sister's name and my own our
 apologies ""
 ""yours truly ""j cameron """
Chapter 8,"viii how it happened
she was a writing medium this is what she wrote:--
i can remember some things upon that evening most distinctly and others
are like some vague broken dreams that is what makes it so difficult
to tell a connected story i have no idea now what it was that had taken
me to london and brought me back so late it just merges into all my
other visits to london but from the time that i got out at the little
country station everything is extraordinarily clear i can live it
again--every instant of it i remember so well walking down the platform and looking at the
illuminated clock at the end which told me that it was half-past eleven i remember also my wondering whether i could get home before midnight then i remember the big motor with its glaring head-lights and glitter
of polished brass waiting for me outside it was my new thirty-horse-
power robur which had only been delivered that day i remember also
asking perkins my chauffeur how she had gone and his saying that he
thought she was excellent ""i'll try her myself "" said i and i climbed into the driver's seat ""the gears are not the same "" said he ""perhaps sir i had better
drive ""
""no; i should like to try her "" said i and so we started on the five-mile drive for home my old car had the gears as they used always to be in notches on a bar in this car you passed the gear-lever through a gate to get on the higher
ones it was not difficult to master and soon i thought that i
understood it it was foolish no doubt to begin to learn a new system
in the dark but one often does foolish things and one has not always to
pay the full price for them i got along very well until i came to
claystall hill it is one of the worst hills in england a mile and a
half long and one in six in places with three fairly sharp curves my
park gates stand at the very foot of it upon the main london road we were just over the brow of this hill where the grade is steepest when the trouble began i had been on the top speed and wanted to get
her on the free; but she stuck between gears and i had to get her back
on the top again by this time she was going at a great rate so i
clapped on both brakes and one after the other they gave way i didn't
mind so much when i felt my footbrake snap but when i put all my weight
on my side-brake and the lever clanged to its full limit without a
catch it brought a cold sweat out of me by this time we were fairly
tearing down the slope the lights were brilliant and i brought her
round the first curve all right then we did the second one though it
was a close shave for the ditch there was a mile of straight then with
the third curve beneath it and after that the gate of the park if i
could shoot into that harbour all would be well for the slope up to the
house would bring her to a stand perkins behaved splendidly i should like that to be known he was
perfectly cool and alert i had thought at the very beginning of taking
the bank and he read my intention ""i wouldn't do it sir "" said he ""at this pace it must go over and we
should have it on the top of us ""
of course he was right he got to the electric switch and had it off so
we were in the free; but we were still running at a fearful pace he
laid his hands on the wheel ""i'll keep her steady "" said he ""if you care to jump and chance it we
can never get round that curve better jump sir ""
""no "" said i; ""i'll stick it out you can jump if you like ""
""i'll stick it with you sir "" said he if it had been the old car i should have jammed the gear-lever into the
reverse and seen what would happen i expect she would have stripped
her gears or smashed up somehow but it would have been a chance as it
was i was helpless perkins tried to climb across but you couldn't do
it going at that pace the wheels were whirring like a high wind and the
big body creaking and groaning with the strain but the lights were
brilliant and one could steer to an inch i remember thinking what an
awful and yet majestic sight we should appear to any one who met us it
was a narrow road and we were just a great roaring golden death to any
one who came in our path we got round the corner with one wheel three feet high upon the bank i
thought we were surely over but after staggering for a moment she
righted and darted onwards that was the third corner and the last one there was only the park gate now it was facing us but as luck would
have it not facing us directly it was about twenty yards to the left
up the main road into which we ran perhaps i could have done it but i
expect that the steering-gear had been jarred when we ran on the bank the wheel did not turn easily we shot out of the lane i saw the open
gate on the left i whirled round my wheel with all the strength of my
wrists perkins and i threw our bodies across and then the next
instant going at fifty miles an hour my right front wheel struck full
on the right-hand pillar of my own gate i heard the crash i was
conscious of flying through the air and then--and then-- * * * * *
when i became aware of my own existence once more i was among some
brushwood in the shadow of the oaks upon the lodge side of the drive a
man was standing beside me i imagined at first that it was perkins but
when i looked again i saw that it was stanley a man whom i had known at
college some years before and for whom i had a really genuine affection there was always something peculiarly sympathetic to me in stanley's
personality; and i was proud to think that i had some similar influence
upon him at the present moment i was surprised to see him but i was
like a man in a dream giddy and shaken and quite prepared to take things
as i found them without questioning them ""what a smash "" i said ""good lord what an awful smash ""
he nodded his head and even in the gloom i could see that he was smiling
the gentle wistful smile which i connected with him i was quite unable to move indeed i had not any desire to try to move but my senses were exceedingly alert i saw the wreck of the motor lit
up by the moving lanterns i saw the little group of people and heard
the hushed voices there were the lodge-keeper and his wife and one or
two more they were taking no notice of me but were very busy round the
car then suddenly i heard a cry of pain ""the weight is on him lift it easy "" cried a voice ""it's only my leg "" said another one which i recognized as perkins's ""where's master "" he cried ""here i am "" i answered but they did not seem to hear me they were all
bending over something which lay in front of the car stanley laid his hand upon my shoulder and his touch was inexpressibly
soothing i felt light and happy in spite of all ""no pain of course "" said he ""none "" said i ""there never is "" said he and then suddenly a wave of amazement passed over me stanley stanley why stanley had surely died of enteric at bloemfontein in the boer war ""stanley "" i cried and the words seemed to choke my throat--""stanley you are dead ""
he looked at me with the same old gentle wistful smile ""so are you "" he answered "
Chapter 9,"ix the prisoner's defence
the circumstances so far as they were known to the public concerning
the death of the beautiful miss ena garnier and the fact that captain
john fowler the accused officer had refused to defend himself on the
occasion of the proceedings at the police-court had roused very general
interest this was increased by the statement that though he withheld
his defence it would be found to be of a very novel and convincing
character the assertion of the prisoner's lawyer at the police-court to the effect that the answer to the charge was such that it could not
yet be given but would be available before the assizes also caused much
speculation a final touch was given to the curiosity of the public when
it was learned that the prisoner had refused all offers of legal
assistance from counsel and was determined to conduct his own defence the case for the crown was ably presented and was generally considered
to be a very damning one since it showed very clearly that the accused
was subject to fits of jealousy and that he had already been guilty of
some violence owing to this cause the prisoner listened to the evidence
without emotion and neither interrupted nor cross-questioned the
witnesses finally on being informed that the time had come when he
might address the jury he stepped to the front of the dock he was a
man of striking appearance swarthy black-moustached nervous and
virile with a quietly confident manner taking a paper from his pocket
he read the following statement which made the deepest impression upon
the crowded court:--
i would wish to say in the first place gentlemen of the jury that owing to the generosity of my brother officers--for my own means are
limited--i might have been defended to-day by the first talent of the
bar the reason i have declined their assistance and have determined to
fight my own case is not that i have any confidence in my own abilities
or eloquence but it is because i am convinced that a plain straightforward tale coming direct from the man who has been the tragic
actor in this dreadful affair will impress you more than any indirect
statement could do if i had felt that i were guilty i should have asked
for help since in my own heart i believe that i am innocent i am
pleading my own cause feeling that my plain words of truth and reason
will have more weight with you than the most learned and eloquent
advocate by the indulgence of the court i have been permitted to put my
remarks upon paper so that i may reproduce certain conversations and be
assured of saying neither more nor less than i mean it will be remembered that at the trial at the police-court two months
ago i refused to defend myself this has been referred to to-day as a
proof of my guilt i said that it would be some days before i could open
my mouth this was taken at the time as a subterfuge well the days
are over and i am now able to make clear to you not only what took
place but also why it was impossible for me to give any explanation i
will tell you now exactly what i did and why it was that i did it if
you my fellow-countrymen think that i did wrong i will make no
complaint but will suffer in silence any penalty which you may impose
upon me i am a soldier of fifteen years' standing a captain in the second
breconshire battalion i have served in the south african campaign and
was mentioned in despatches after the battle of diamond hill when the
war broke out with germany i was seconded from my regiment and i was
appointed as adjutant to the first scottish scouts newly raised the
regiment was quartered at radchurch in essex where the men were placed
partly in huts and were partly billeted upon the inhabitants all the
officers were billeted out and my quarters were with mr murreyfield the local squire it was there that i first met miss ena garnier it may not seem proper at such a time and place as this that i should
describe that lady and yet her personality is the very essence of my
case let me only say that i cannot believe that nature ever put into
female form a more exquisite combination of beauty and intelligence she
was twenty-five years of age blonde and tall with a peculiar delicacy
of features and of expression i have read of people falling in love at
first sight and had always looked upon it as an expression of the
novelist and yet from the moment that i saw ena garnier life held for
me but the one ambition--that she should be mine i had never dreamed
before of the possibilities of passion that were within me i will not
enlarge upon the subject but to make you understand my action--for i
wish you to comprehend it however much you may condemn it--you must
realize that i was in the grip of a frantic elementary passion which
made for a time the world and all that was in it seem a small thing if
i could but gain the love of this one girl and yet in justice to
myself i will say that there was always one thing which i placed above
her that was my honour as a soldier and a gentleman you will find it
hard to believe this when i tell you what occurred and yet--though for
one moment i forgot myself--my whole legal offence consists in my
desperate endeavour to retrieve what i had done i soon found that the lady was not insensible to the advances which i
made to her her position in the household was a curious one she had
come a year before from montpellier in the south of france in answer to
an advertisement from the murreyfields in order to teach french to their
three young children she was however unpaid so that she was rather a
friendly guest than an _employee_ she had always as i gathered been
fond of the english and desirous to live in england but the outbreak of
the war had quickened her feelings into passionate attachment for the
ruling emotion of her soul was her hatred of the germans her
grandfather as she told me had been killed under very tragic
circumstances in the campaign of 1870 and her two brothers were both in
the french army her voice vibrated with passion when she spoke of the
infamies of belgium and more than once i have seen her kissing my sword
and my revolver because she hoped they would be used upon the enemy with
such feelings in her heart it can be imagined that my wooing was not a
difficult one i should have been glad to marry her at once but to this
she would not consent everything was to come after the war for it was
necessary she said that i should go to montpellier and meet her people so that the french proprieties should be properly observed she had one accomplishment which was rare for a lady; she was a skilled
motor-cyclist she had been fond of long solitary rides but after our
engagement i was occasionally allowed to accompany her she was a woman however of strange moods and fancies which added in my feelings to the
charm of her character she could be tenderness itself and she could be
aloof and even harsh in her manner more than once she had refused my
company with no reason given and with a quick angry flash of her eyes
when i asked for one then perhaps her mood would change and she would
make up for this unkindness by some exquisite attention which would in an
instant soothe all my ruffled feelings it was the same in the house my
military duties were so exacting that it was only in the evenings that i
could hope to see her and yet very often she remained in the little
study which was used during the day for the children's lessons and would
tell me plainly that she wished to be alone then when she saw that i
was hurt by her caprice she would laugh and apologize so sweetly for her
rudeness that i was more her slave than ever mention has been made of my jealous disposition and it has been asserted
at the trial that there were scenes owing to my jealousy and that once
mrs murreyfield had to interfere i admit that i was jealous when a
man loves with the whole strength of his soul it is impossible i think that he should be clear of jealousy the girl was of a very independent
spirit i found that she knew many officers at chelmsford and
colchester she would disappear for hours together upon her motor-cycle there were questions about her past life which she would only answer with
a smile unless they were closely pressed then the smile would become a
frown is it any wonder that i with my whole nature vibrating with
passionate whole-hearted love was often torn by jealousy when i came
upon those closed doors of her life which she was so determined not to
open reason came at times and whispered how foolish it was that i
should stake my whole life and soul upon one of whom i really knew
nothing then came a wave of passion once more and reason was submerged i have spoken of the closed doors of her life i was aware that a young unmarried frenchwoman has usually less liberty than her english sister and yet in the case of this lady it continually came out in her
conversation that she had seen and known much of the world it was the
more distressing to me as whenever she had made an observation which
pointed to this she would afterwards as i could plainly see be annoyed
by her own indiscretion and endeavour to remove the impression by every
means in her power we had several small quarrels on this account when
i asked questions to which i could get no answers but they have been
exaggerated in the address for the prosecution too much has been made
also of the intervention of mrs murreyfield though i admit that the
quarrel was more serious upon that occasion it arose from my finding
the photograph of a man upon her table and her evident confusion when i
asked her for some particulars about him the name ""h vardin"" was
written underneath--evidently an autograph i was worried by the fact
that this photograph had the frayed appearance of one which has been
carried secretly about as a girl might conceal the picture of her lover
in her dress she absolutely refused to give me any information about
him save to make a statement which i found incredible that it was a man
whom she had never seen in her life it was then that i forgot myself i
raised my voice and declared that i should know more about her life or
that i should break with her even if my own heart should be broken in
the parting i was not violent but mrs murreyfield heard me from the
passage and came into the room to remonstrate she was a kind motherly
person who took a sympathetic interest in our romance and i remember
that on this occasion she reproved me for my jealousy and finally
persuaded me that i had been unreasonable so that we became reconciled
once more ena was so madly fascinating and i so hopelessly her slave
that she could always draw me back however much prudence and reason
warned me to escape from her control i tried again and again to find
out about this man vardin but was always met by the same assurance which she repeated with every kind of solemn oath that she had never
seen the man in her life why she should carry about the photograph of a
man--a young somewhat sinister man for i had observed him closely
before she snatched the picture from my hand--was what she either could
not or would not explain then came the time for my leaving radchurch i had been appointed to a
junior but very responsible post at the war office which of course entailed my living in london even my week-ends found me engrossed with
my work but at last i had a few days' leave of absence it is those few
days which have ruined my life which have brought me the most horrible
experience that ever a man had to undergo and have finally placed me
here in the dock pleading as i plead to-day for my life and my honour it is nearly five miles from the station to radchurch she was there to
meet me it was the first time that we had been reunited since i had put
all my heart and my soul upon her i cannot enlarge upon these matters gentlemen you will either be able to sympathize with and understand the
emotions which overbalance a man at such a time or you will not if you
have imagination you will if you have not i can never hope to make
you see more than the bare fact that bare fact placed in the baldest
language is that during this drive from radchurch junction to the
village i was led into the greatest indiscretion--the greatest dishonour if you will--of my life i told the woman a secret an enormously
important secret which might affect the fate of the war and the lives of
many thousands of men it was done before i knew it--before i grasped the way in which her quick
brain could place various scattered hints together and weave them into
one idea she was wailing almost weeping over the fact that the allied
armies were held up by the iron line of the germans i explained that it
was more correct to say that our iron line was holding them up since
they were the invaders ""but is france is belgium _never_ to be rid of
them "" she cried ""are we simply to sit in front of their trenches and
be content to let them do what they will with ten provinces of france oh jack jack for god's sake say something to bring a little hope to
my heart for sometimes i think that it is breaking you english are
stolid you can bear these things but we others we have more nerve more soul it is death to us tell me do tell me that there is hope and yet it is foolish of me to ask for of course you are only a
subordinate at the war office and how should you know what is in the
mind of your chiefs ""
""well as it happens i know a good deal "" i answered ""don't fret for
we shall certainly get a move on soon ""
""soon next year may seem soon to some people ""
""it's not next year ""
""must we wait another month ""
""not even that ""
she squeezed my hand in hers ""oh my darling boy you have brought such
joy to my heart what suspense i shall live in now i think a week of
it would kill me ""
""well perhaps it won't even be a week ""
""and tell me "" she went on in her coaxing voice ""tell me just one
thing jack just one and i will trouble you no more is it our brave
french soldiers who advance or is it your splendid tommies with whom
will the honour lie ""
""with both ""
""glorious "" she cried ""i see it all the attack will be at the point
where the french and british lines join together they will rush forward
in one glorious advance ""
""no "" i said ""they will not be together ""
""but i understood you to say--of course women know nothing of such
matters but i understood you to say that it would be a joint advance ""
""well if the french advanced we will say at verdun and the british
advanced at ypres even if they were hundreds of miles apart it would
still be a joint advance ""
""ah i see "" she cried clapping her hands with delight ""they would
advance at both ends of the line so that the boches would not know which
way to send their reserves ""
""that is exactly the idea--a real advance at verdun and an enormous
feint at ypres ""
then suddenly a chill of doubt seized me i can remember how i sprang
back from her and looked hard into her face ""i've told you too much "" i
cried ""can i trust you i have been mad to say so much ""
she was bitterly hurt by my words that i should for a moment doubt her
was more than she could bear ""i would cut my tongue out jack before i
would tell any human being one word of what you have said "" so earnest
was she that my fears died away i felt that i could trust her utterly before we had reached radchurch i had put the matter from my mind and we
were lost in our joy of the present and in our plans for the future i had a business message to deliver to colonel worral who commanded a
small camp at pedley-woodrow i went there and was away for about two
hours when i returned i inquired for miss garnier and was told by the
maid that she had gone to her bedroom and that she had asked the groom
to bring her motor-bicycle to the door it seemed to me strange that she
should arrange to go out alone when my visit was such a short one i had
gone into her little study to seek her and here it was that i waited for it opened on to the hall passage and she could not pass without my
seeing her there was a small table in the window of this room at which she used to
write i had seated myself beside this when my eyes fell upon a name
written in her large bold hand-writing it was a reversed impression
upon the blotting-paper which she had used but there could be no
difficulty in reading it the name was hubert vardin apparently it was
part of the address of an envelope for underneath i was able to
distinguish the initials s w referring to a postal division of london though the actual name of the street had not been clearly reproduced then i knew for the first time that she was actually corresponding with
this man whose vile voluptuous face i had seen in the photograph with
the frayed edges she had clearly lied to me too for was it
conceivable that she should correspond with a man whom she had never
seen i don't desire to condone my conduct put yourself in my place imagine that you had my desperately fervid and jealous nature you would
have done what i did for you could have done nothing else a wave of
fury passed over me i laid my hands upon the wooden writing-desk if
it had been an iron safe i should have opened it as it was it
literally flew to pieces before me there lay the letter itself placed
under lock and key for safety while the writer prepared to take it from
the house i had no hesitation or scruple i tore it open dishonourable you will say but when a man is frenzied with jealousy he
hardly knows what he does this woman for whom i was ready to give
everything was either faithful to me or she was not at any cost i
would know which a thrill of joy passed through me as my eyes fell upon the first words i
had wronged her ""cher monsieur vardin "" so the letter began it was
clearly a business letter nothing else i was about to replace it in
the envelope with a thousand regrets in my mind for my want of faith when
a single word at the bottom of the page caught my eyes and i started as
if i had been stung by an adder ""verdun""--that was the word i looked
again ""ypres"" was immediately below it i sat down horror-stricken by the broken desk and i read this letter a translation of which i have
in my hand:--
 murreyfield house radchurch dear m vardin --stringer has told me that he has kept you
 sufficiently informed as to chelmsford and colchester so i have not
 troubled to write they have moved the midland territorial brigade
 and the heavy guns towards the coast near cromer but only for a time it is for training not embarkation and now for my great news which i have straight from the war office
 itself within a week there is to be a very severe attack from
 verdun which is to be supported by a holding attack at ypres it is
 all on a very large scale and you must send off a special dutch
 messenger to von starmer by the first boat i hope to get the exact
 date and some further particulars from my informant to-night but
 meanwhile you must act with energy i dare not post this here--you know what village postmasters are so i
 am taking it into colchester where stringer will include it with his
 own report which goes by hand --yours faithfully sophia heffner i was stunned at first as i read this letter and then a kind of cold concentrated rage came over me so this woman was a german and a spy i
thought of her hypocrisy and her treachery towards me but above all i
thought of the danger to the army and the state a great defeat the
death of thousands of men might spring from my misplaced confidence there was still time by judgment and energy to stop this frightful
evil i heard her step upon the stairs outside and an instant later she
had come through the doorway she started and her face was bloodless as
she saw me seated there with the open letter in my hand ""how did you get that "" she gasped ""how dared you break my desk and
steal my letter ""
i said nothing i simply sat and looked at her and pondered what i
should do she suddenly sprang forward and tried to snatch the letter i
caught her wrist and pushed her down on to the sofa where she lay collapsed then i rang the bell and told the maid that i must see mr murreyfield at once he was a genial elderly man who had treated this woman with as much
kindness as if she were his daughter he was horrified at what i said i
could not show him the letter on account of the secret that it contained but i made him understand that it was of desperate importance ""what are we to do "" he asked ""i never could have imagined anything so
dreadful what would you advise us to do ""
""there is only one thing that we can do "" i answered ""this woman must
be arrested and in the meanwhile we must so arrange matters that she
cannot possibly communicate with any one for all we know she has
confederates in this very village can you undertake to hold her
securely while i go to colonel worral at pedley and get a warrant and a
guard ""
""we can lock her in her bedroom ""
""you need not trouble "" said she ""i give you my word that i will stay
where i am i advise you to be careful captain fowler you've shown
once before that you are liable to do things before you have thought of
the consequence if i am arrested all the world will know that you have
given away the secrets that were confided to you there is an end of
your career my friend you can punish me no doubt what about
yourself ""
""i think "" said i ""you had best take her to her bedroom ""
""very good if you wish it "" said she and followed us to the door when
we reached the hall she suddenly broke away dashed through the entrance and made for her motor-bicycle which was standing there before she
could start we had both seized her she stooped and made her teeth meet
in murreyfield's hand with flashing eyes and tearing fingers she was as
fierce as a wild cat at bay it was with some difficulty that we
mastered her and dragged her--almost carried her--up the stairs we
thrust her into her room and turned the key while she screamed out abuse
and beat upon the door inside ""it's a forty-foot drop into the garden "" said murreyfield tying up his
bleeding hand ""i'll wait here till you come back i think we have the
lady fairly safe ""
""i have a revolver here "" said i ""you should be armed "" i slipped a
couple of cartridges into it and held it out to him ""we can't afford to
take chances how do you know what friends she may have ""
""thank you "" said he ""i have a stick here and the gardener is within
call do you hurry off for the guard and i will answer for the
prisoner ""
having taken as it seemed to me every possible precaution i ran to
give the alarm it was two miles to pedley and the colonel was out which occasioned some delay then there were formalities and a
magistrate's signature to be obtained a policeman was to serve the
warrant but a military escort was to be sent in to bring back the
prisoner i was so filled with anxiety and impatience that i could not
wait but i hurried back alone with the promise that they would follow the pedley-woodrow road opens into the high-road to colchester at a point
about half a mile from the village of radchurch it was evening now and
the light was such that one could not see more than twenty or thirty
yards ahead i had proceeded only a very short way from the point of
junction when i heard coming towards me the roar of a motor-cycle being
ridden at a furious pace it was without lights and close upon me i
sprang aside in order to avoid being ridden down and in that instant as
the machine flashed by i saw clearly the face of the rider it was
she--the woman whom i had loved she was hatless her hair streaming in
the wind her face glimmering white in the twilight flying through the
night like one of the valkyries of her native land she was past me like
a flash and tore on down the colchester road in that instant i saw all
that it would mean if she could reach the town if she once was allowed
to see her agent we might arrest him or her but it would be too late the news would have been passed on the victory of the allies and the
lives of thousands of our soldiers were at stake next instant i had
pulled out the loaded revolver and fired two shots after the vanishing
figure already only a dark blur in the dusk i heard a scream the
crashing of the breaking cycle and all was still i need not tell you more gentlemen you know the rest when i ran
forward i found her lying in the ditch both of my bullets had struck
her one of them had penetrated her brain i was still standing beside
her body when murreyfield arrived running breathlessly down the road she had it seemed with great courage and activity scrambled down the
ivy of the wall; only when he heard the whirr of the cycle did he realize
what had occurred he was explaining it to my dazed brain when the
police and soldiers arrived to arrest her by the irony of fate it was
me whom they arrested instead it was urged at the trial in the police-court that jealousy was the cause
of the crime i did not deny it nor did i put forward any witnesses to
deny it it was my desire that they should believe it the hour of the
french advance had not yet come and i could not defend myself without
producing the letter which would reveal it but now it is
over--gloriously over--and so my lips are unsealed at last i confess my
fault--my very grievous fault but it is not that for which you are
trying me it is for murder i should have thought myself the murderer
of my own countrymen if i had let the woman pass these are the facts gentlemen i leave my future in your hands if you should absolve me i
may say that i have hopes of serving my country in a fashion which will
atone for this one great indiscretion and will also as i hope end for
ever those terrible recollections which weigh me down if you condemn
me i am ready to face whatever you may think fit to inflict "
Chapter 10,"x three of them
i--a chat about children snakes and zebus
these little sketches are called ""three of them "" but there are really
five on and off the stage there is daddy a lumpish person with some
gift for playing indian games when he is in the mood he is then known
as ""the great chief of the leatherskin tribe "" then there is my lady
sunshine these are the grown-ups and don't really count there remain
the three who need some differentiating upon paper though their little
spirits are as different in reality as spirits could be--all beautiful
and all quite different the eldest is a boy of eight whom we shall call
""laddie "" if ever there was a little cavalier sent down ready-made it is
he his soul is the most gallant unselfish innocent thing that ever
god sent out to get an extra polish upon earth it dwells in a tall slight well-formed body graceful and agile with a head and face as
clean-cut as if an old greek cameo had come to life and a pair of
innocent and yet wise grey eyes that read and win the heart he is shy
and does not shine before strangers i have said that he is unselfish
and brave when there is the usual wrangle about going to bed up he
gets in his sedate way ""i will go first "" says he and off he goes the
eldest that the others may have the few extra minutes while he is in his
bath as to his courage he is absolutely lion-hearted where he can help
or defend any one else on one occasion daddy lost his temper with
dimples (boy number 2) and not without very good provocation gave him
a tap on the side of the head next instant he felt a butt down
somewhere in the region of his waist-belt and there was an angry little
red face looking up at him which turned suddenly to a brown mop of hair
as the butt was repeated no one not even daddy should hit his little
brother such was laddie the gentle and the fearless then there is dimples dimples is nearly seven and you never saw a
rounder softer dimplier face with two great roguish mischievous eyes
of wood-pigeon grey which are sparkling with fun for the most part though they can look sad and solemn enough at times dimples has the
making of a big man in him he has depth and reserves in his tiny soul but on the surface he is a boy of boys always in innocent mischief ""i
will now do mischuff "" he occasionally announces and is usually as good
as his word he has a love and understanding of all living creatures the uglier and more slimy the better treating them all in a tender fairylike fashion which seems to come from some inner knowledge he has
been found holding a buttercup under the mouth of a slug ""to see if he
likes butter "" he finds creatures in an astonishing way put him in the
fairest garden and presently he will approach you with a newt a toad or a huge snail in his custody nothing would ever induce him to hurt
them but he gives them what he imagines to be a little treat and then
restores them to their homes he has been known to speak bitterly to the
lady when she has given orders that caterpillars be killed if found upon
the cabbages and even the explanation that the caterpillars were doing
the work of what he calls ""the jarmans"" did not reconcile him to their
fate he has an advantage over laddie in that he suffers from no trace of
shyness and is perfectly friendly in an instant with any one of every
class of life plunging straight into conversation with some such remark
as ""can your daddy give a war-whoop "" or ""were you ever chased by a
bear "" he is a sunny creature but combative sometimes when he draws
down his brows sets his eyes his chubby cheeks flush and his lips go
back from his almond-white teeth ""i am swankie the berserker "" says he quoting out of his favourite ""erling the bold "" which daddy reads aloud
at bed-time when he is in this fighting mood he can even drive back
laddie chiefly because the elder is far too chivalrous to hurt him if
you want to see what laddie can really do put the small gloves on him
and let him go for daddy some of those hurricane rallies of his would
stop daddy grinning if they could get home and he has to fall back off
his stool in order to get away from them if that latent power of dimples should ever come out how will it be
manifest surely in his imagination tell him a story and the boy is
lost he sits with his little round rosy face immovable and fixed while his eyes never budge from those of the speaker he sucks in
everything that is weird or adventurous or wild laddie is a rather
restless soul eager to be up and doing; but dimples is absorbed in the
present if there be something worth hearing to be heard in height he is
half a head shorter than his brother but rather more sturdy in build the power of his voice is one of his noticeable characteristics if
dimples is coming you know it well in advance with that physical gift
upon the top of his audacity and his loquacity he fairly takes command
of any place in which he may find himself while laddie his soul too
noble for jealousy becomes one of the laughing and admiring audience then there is baby a dainty elfin dresden-china little creature of five as fair as an angel and as deep as a well the boys are but shallow sparkling pools compared with this little girl with her self-repression
and dainty aloofness you know the boys you never feel that you quite
know the girl something very strong and forceful seems to be at the
back of that wee body her will is tremendous nothing can break or
even bend it only kind guidance and friendly reasoning can mould it the boys are helpless if she has really made up her mind but this is
only when she asserts herself and those are rare occasions as a rule
she sits quiet aloof affable keenly alive to all that passes and yet
taking no part in it save for some subtle smile or glance and then
suddenly the wonderful grey-blue eyes under the long black lashes will
gleam like coy diamonds and such a hearty little chuckle will come from
her that every one else is bound to laugh out of sympathy she and
dimples are great allies and yet have continual lovers' quarrels one
night she would not even include his name in her prayers ""god bless--""
every one else but not a word of dimples ""come come darling "" urged
the lady ""well then god bless horrid dimples "" said she at last after she had named the cat the goat her dolls and her wriggly that is a strange trait the love for the wriggly it would repay
thought from some scientific brain it is an old faded disused downy
from her cot yet go where she will she must take wriggly with her all
her toys put together would not console her for the absence of wriggly if the family go to the seaside wriggly must come too she will not
sleep without the absurd bundle in her arms if she goes to a party she
insists upon dragging its disreputable folds along with her one end
always projecting ""to give it fresh air "" every phase of childhood
represents to the philosopher something in the history of the race from
the new-born baby which can hang easily by one hand from a broomstick
with its legs drawn up under it the whole evolution of mankind is re-
enacted you can trace clearly the cave-dweller the hunter the scout what then does wriggly represent fetish worship--nothing else the
savage chooses some most unlikely thing and adores it this dear little
savage adores her wriggly so now we have our three little figures drawn as clearly as a clumsy pen
can follow such subtle elusive creatures of mood and fancy we will
suppose now that it is a summer evening that daddy is seated smoking in
his chair that the lady is listening somewhere near and that the three
are in a tumbled heap upon the bear-skin before the empty fireplace
trying to puzzle out the little problems of their tiny lives when three
children play with a new thought it is like three kittens with a ball one giving it a pat and another a pat as they chase it from point to
point daddy would interfere as little as possible save when he was
called upon to explain or to deny it was usually wiser for him to
pretend to be doing something else then their talk was the more
natural on this occasion however he was directly appealed to ""daddy "" asked dimples ""yes boy ""
""do you fink that the roses know us ""
dimples in spite of his impish naughtiness had a way of looking such a
perfectly innocent and delightfully kissable little person that one felt
he really might be a good deal nearer to the sweet secrets of nature than
his elders however daddy was in a material mood ""no boy; how could the roses know us ""
""the big yellow rose at the corner of the gate knows _me_ ""
""how do you know that ""
""'cause it nodded to me yesterday ""
laddie roared with laughter ""that was just the wind dimples ""
""no it was not "" said dimples with conviction ""there was none wind baby was there weren't you baby ""
""the wose knew us "" said baby gravely ""beasts know us "" said laddie ""but them beasts run round and make
noises roses don't make noises ""
""yes they do they rustle ""
""woses wustle "" said baby ""that's not a living noise that's an all-the-same noise different to
roy who barks and makes different noises all the time fancy the roses
all barkin' at you daddy will you tell us about animals ""
that is one of the child stages which takes us back to the old tribe
life--their inexhaustible interest in animals some distant echo of those
long nights when wild men sat round the fires and peered out into the
darkness and whispered about all the strange and deadly creatures who
fought with them for the lordship of the earth children love caves and
they love fires and meals out of doors and they love animal talk--all
relics of the far distant past ""what is the biggest animal in south america daddy ""
daddy wearily: ""oh i don't know ""
""i s'pose an elephant would be the biggest ""
""no boy; there are none in south america ""
""well then a rhinoceros ""
""no there are none ""
""well what is there daddy ""
""well dear there are jaguars i suppose a jaguar is the biggest ""
""then it must be thirty-six feet long ""
""oh no boy; about eight or nine feet with his tail ""
""but there are boa-constrictors in south america thirty-six feet long ""
""that's different ""
""do you fink "" asked dimples with his big solemn grey eyes wide open ""there was ever a boa-'strictor forty-five feet long ""
""no dear; i never heard of one ""
""perhaps there was one but you never heard of it do you fink you would
have heard of a boa-'strictor forty-five feet long if there was one in
south america ""
""well there may have been one ""
""daddy "" said laddie carrying on the cross-examination with the intense
earnestness of a child ""could a boa-constrictor swallow any small
animal ""
""yes of course he could ""
""could he swallow a jaguar ""
""well i don't know about that a jaguar is a very large animal ""
""well then "" asked dimples ""could a jaguar swallow a boa-'strictor ""
""silly ass "" said laddie ""if a jaguar was only nine feet long and the
boa-constrictor was thirty-five feet long then there would be a lot
sticking out of the jaguar's mouth how could he swallow that ""
""he'd bite it off "" said dimples ""and then another slice for supper and
another for breakfast--but i say daddy a 'stricter couldn't swallow a
porkpine could he he would have a sore throat all the way down ""
shrieks of laughter and a welcome rest for daddy who turned to his
paper ""daddy ""
he put down his paper with an air of conscious virtue and lit his pipe ""well dear ""
""what's the biggest snake you ever saw ""
""oh bother the snakes i am tired of them ""
but the children were never tired of them heredity again for the snake
was the worst enemy of arboreal man ""daddy made soup out of a snake "" said laddie ""tell us about that
snake daddy ""
children like a story best the fourth or fifth time so it is never any
use to tell them that they know all about it the story which they can
check and correct is their favourite ""well dear we got a viper and we killed it then we wanted the
skeleton to keep and we didn't know how to get it at first we thought
we would bury it but that seemed too slow then i had the idea to boil
all the viper's flesh off its bones and i got an old meat-tin and we put
the viper and some water into it and put it above the fire ""
""you hung it on a hook daddy ""
""yes we hung it on the hook that they put the porridge pot on in
scotland then just as it was turning brown in came the farmer's wife and ran up to see what we were cooking when she saw the viper she
thought we were going to eat it 'oh you dirty divils ' she cried and
caught up the tin in her apron and threw it out of the window ""
fresh shrieks of laughter from the children and dimples repeated ""you
dirty divil "" until daddy had to clump him playfully on the head ""tell us some more about snakes "" cried laddie ""did you ever see a
really dreadful snake ""
""one that would turn you black and dead you in five minutes "" said
dimples it was always the most awful thing that appealed to dimples ""yes i have seen some beastly creatures once in the sudan i was dozing
on the sand when i opened my eyes and there was a horrid creature like a
big slug with horns short and thick about a foot long moving away in
front of me ""
""what was it daddy "" six eager eyes were turned up to him ""it was a death-adder i expect that would dead you in five minutes dimples if it got a bite at you ""
""did you kill it ""
""no; it was gone before i could get to it ""
""which is the horridest daddy--a snake or a shark ""
""i'm not very fond of either ""
""did you ever see a man eaten by sharks ""
""no dear but i was not so far off being eaten myself ""
""oo "" from all three of them ""i did a silly thing for i swam round the ship in water where there are
many sharks as i was drying myself on the deck i saw the high fin of a
shark above the water a little way off it had heard the splashing and
come up to look for me ""
""weren't you frightened daddy ""
""yes it made me feel rather cold "" there was silence while daddy saw
once more the golden sand of the african beach and the snow-white roaring
surf with the long smooth swell of the bar children don't like silences ""daddy "" said laddie ""do zebus bite ""
""zebus why they are cows no of course not ""
""but a zebu could butt with its horns ""
""oh yes it could butt ""
""do you think a zebu could fight a crocodile ""
""well i should back the crocodile ""
""why ""
""well dear the crocodile has great teeth and would eat the zebu ""
""but suppose the zebu came up when the crocodile was not looking and
butted it ""
""well that would be one up for the zebu but one butt wouldn't hurt a
crocodile ""
""no one wouldn't would it but the zebu would keep on crocodiles
live on sand-banks don't they well then the zebu would come and live
near the sandbank too--just so far as the crocodile would never see him then every time the crocodile wasn't looking the zebu would butt him don't you think he would beat the crocodile ""
""well perhaps he would ""
""how long do you think it would take the zebu to beat the crocodile ""
""well it would depend upon how often he got in his butt ""
""well suppose he butted him once every three hours don't you think-- ""
""oh bother the zebu ""
""that's what the crocodile would say "" cried laddie clapping his hands ""well i agree with the crocodile "" said daddy ""and it's time all good children were in bed "" said the lady as the
glimmer of the nurse's apron was seen in the gloom ii--about cricket
supper was going on down below and all good children should have been
long ago in the land of dreams yet a curious noise came from above ""what on earth-- "" asked daddy ""laddie practising cricket "" said the lady with the curious clairvoyance
of motherhood ""he gets out of bed to bowl i do wish you would go up
and speak seriously to him about it for it takes quite an hour off his
rest ""
daddy departed upon his mission intending to be gruff and my word he
can be quite gruff when he likes when he reached the top of the stairs however and heard the noise still continue he walked softly down the
landing and peeped in through the half-opened door the room was dark save for a night-light in the dim glimmer he saw a
little white-clad figure slight and supple taking short steps and
swinging its arm in the middle of the room ""halloa "" said daddy the white-clad figure turned and ran forward to him ""oh daddy how jolly of you to come up ""
daddy felt that gruffness was not quite so easy as it had seemed ""look here you get into bed "" he said with the best imitation he could
manage ""yes daddy but before i go how is this "" he sprang forward and the
arm swung round again in a swift and graceful gesture daddy was a moth-eaten cricketer of sorts and he took it in with a
critical eye ""good laddie i like a high action that's the real spofforth swing ""
""oh daddy come and talk about cricket "" he was pulled on the side of
the bed and the white figure dived between the sheets ""yes; tell us about cwicket "" came a cooing voice from the corner dimples was sitting up in his cot ""you naughty boy i thought one of you was asleep anyhow i mustn't
stay i keep you awake ""
""who was popoff "" cried laddie clutching at his father's sleeve ""was
he a very good bowler ""
""spofforth was the best bowler that ever walked on to a cricket-field he
was the great australian bowler and he taught us a great deal ""
""did he ever kill a dog "" from dimples ""no boy why ""
""because laddie said there was a bowler so fast that his ball went frue a
coat and killed a dog ""
""oh that's an old yarn i heard that when i was a little boy about some
bowler whose name i think was jackson ""
""was it a big dog ""
""no no son; it wasn't a dog at all ""
""it was a cat "" said dimples ""no; i tell you it never happened ""
""but tell us about spofforth "" cried laddie dimples with his
imaginative mind usually wandered while the elder came eagerly back to
the point ""was he very fast ""
""he could be very fast i have heard cricketers who had played against
him say that his yorker--that is a ball which is just short of a full
pitch--was the fastest ball in england i have myself seen his long arm
swing round and the wicket go down before ever the batsman had time to
ground his bat ""
""oo "" from both beds ""he was a tall thin man and they called him the fiend that means the
devil you know ""
""and _was_ he the devil ""
""no dimples no they called him that because he did such wonderful
things with the ball ""
""can the devil do wonderful things with a ball ""
daddy felt that he was propagating devil-worship and hastened to get to
safer ground ""spofforth taught us how to bowl and blackham taught us how to keep
wicket when i was young we always had another fielder called the long-
stop who stood behind the wicket-keeper i used to be a thick solid
boy so they put me as long-stop and the balls used to bounce off me i
remember as if i had been a mattress ""
delighted laughter ""but after blackham came wicket-keepers had to learn that they were there
to stop the ball even in good second-class cricket there were no more
long-stops we soon found plenty of good wicket-keeps--like alfred
lyttelton and macgregor--but it was blackham who showed us how to see
spofforth all india-rubber and ginger at one end bowling and blackham with his black beard over the bails waiting for the ball at the other
end was worth living for i can tell you ""
silence while the boys pondered over this but laddie feared daddy would
go so he quickly got in a question if daddy's memory could only be
kept going there was no saying how long they might keep him ""was there no good bowler until spofforth came ""
""oh plenty my boy but he brought something new with him especially
change of pace--you could never tell by his action up to the last moment
whether you were going to get a ball like a flash of lightning or one
that came slow but full of devil and spin but for mere command of the
pitch of a ball i should think alfred shaw of nottingham was the
greatest bowler i can remember it was said that he could pitch a ball
twice in three times upon a half-crown ""
""oo "" and then from dimples:--
""whose half-crown ""
""well anybody's half-crown ""
""did he get the half-crown ""
""no no; why should he ""
""because he put the ball on it ""
""the half-crown was kept there always for people to aim at "" explained
laddie ""no no there never was a half-crown ""
murmurs of remonstrance from both boys ""i only meant that he could pitch the ball on anything--a half-crown or
anything else ""
""daddy "" with the energy of one who has a happy idea ""could he have
pitched it on the batsman's toe ""
""yes boy i think so ""
""well then suppose he _always_ pitched it on the batsman's toe ""
daddy laughed ""perhaps that is why dear old w g always stood with his left toe cocked
up in the air ""
""on one leg ""
""no no dimples with his heel down and his toe up ""
""did you know w g daddy ""
""oh yes i knew him quite well ""
""was he nice ""
""yes he was splendid he was always like a great jolly schoolboy who
was hiding behind a huge black beard ""
""whose beard ""
""i meant that he had a great bushy beard he looked like the pirate
chief in your picture-books but he had as kind a heart as a child i
have been told that it was the terrible things in this war that really
killed him grand old w g ""
""was he the best bat in the world daddy ""
""of course he was "" said daddy beginning to enthuse to the delight of
the clever little plotter in the bed ""there never was such a bat--never
in the world--and i don't believe there ever could be again he didn't
play on smooth wickets as they do now he played where the wickets were
all patchy and you had to watch the ball right on to the bat you
couldn't look at it before it hit the ground and think 'that's all
right i know where that one will be ' my word that was cricket what
you got you earned ""
""did you ever see w g make a hundred daddy ""
""see him i've fielded out for him and melted on a hot august day while
he made a hundred and fifty there's a pound or two of your daddy
somewhere on that field yet but i loved to see it and i was always
sorry when he got out for nothing even if i were playing against him ""
""did he ever get out for nothing ""
""yes dear; the first time i ever played in his company he was given out
leg-before-wicket before he made a run and all the way to the
pavilion--that's where people go when they are out--he was walking
forward but his big black beard was backward over his shoulder as he
told the umpire what he thought ""
""and what _did_ he think ""
""more than i can tell you dimples but i dare say he was right to be
annoyed for it was a left-handed bowler bowling round the wicket and
it is very hard to get leg-before to that however that's all greek to
you ""
""what's gweek ""
""well i mean you can't understand that now i am going ""
""no no daddy; wait a moment tell us about bonner and the big catch ""
""oh you know about that ""
two little coaxing voices came out of the darkness ""oh please please ""
""i don't know what your mother will say what was it you asked ""
""bonner ""
""ah bonner "" daddy looked out in the gloom and saw green fields and
golden sunlight and great sportsmen long gone to their rest ""bonner
was a wonderful man he was a giant in size ""
""as big as you daddy ""
daddy seized his elder boy and shook him playfully ""i heard what you
said to miss cregan the other day when she asked you what an acre was
you said 'about the size of daddy '""
both boys gurgled ""but bonner was five inches taller than i he was a giant i tell you ""
""did nobody kill him ""
""no no dimples not a story-book giant but a great strong man he
had a splendid figure and blue eyes and a golden beard and altogether he
was the finest man i have ever seen--except perhaps one ""
""who was the one daddy ""
""well it was the emperor frederick of germany ""
""a jarman "" cried dimples in horror ""yes a german mind you boys a man may be a very noble man and be a
german--though what has become of the noble ones these last three years
is more than i can guess but frederick was noble and good as you could
see on his face how he ever came to be the father of such a blasphemous
braggart""--daddy sank into reverie ""bonner daddy "" said laddie and daddy came back from politics with a
start ""oh yes bonner bonner in white flannels on the green sward with an
english june sun upon him that was a picture of a man but you asked
me about the catch it was in a test match at the oval--england against
australia bonner said before he went in that he would hit alfred shaw
into the next county and he set out to do it shaw as i have told you could keep a very good length so for some time bonner could not get the
ball he wanted but at last he saw his chance and he jumped out and hit
that ball the most awful ker-wallop that ever was seen in a
cricket-field ""
""oo "" from both boys: and then ""did it go into the next county daddy ""
from dimples ""well i'm telling you "" said daddy who was always testy when one of his
stories was interrupted ""bonner thought he had made the ball a half-
volley--that is the best ball to hit--but shaw had deceived him and the
ball was really on the short side so when bonner hit it up and up it
went until it looked as if it were going out of sight into the sky ""
""oo ""
""at first everybody thought it was going far outside the ground but
soon they saw that all the giant's strength had been wasted in hitting
the ball so high and that there was a chance that it would fall within
the ropes the batsmen had run three runs and it was still in the air then it was seen that an english fielder was standing on the very edge of
the field with his back on the ropes a white figure against the black
line of the people he stood watching the mighty curve of the ball and
twice he raised his hands together above his head as he did so then a
third time he raised his hands above his head and the ball was in them
and bonner was out ""
""why did he raise his hands twice ""
""i don't know he did so ""
""and who was the fielder daddy ""
""the fielder was g f grace the younger brother of w g only a few
months afterwards he was a dead man but he had one grand moment in his
life with twenty thousand people all just mad with excitement poor g f he died too soon ""
""did you ever catch a catch like that daddy ""
""no boy i was never a particularly good fielder ""
""did you never catch a good catch ""
""well i won't say that you see the best catches are very often
flukes and i remember one awful fluke of that sort ""
""do tell us daddy ""
""well dear i was fielding at slip that is very near the wicket you
know woodcock was bowling and he had the name of being the fastest
bowler of england at that time it was just the beginning of the match
and the ball was quite red suddenly i saw something like a red flash
and there was the ball stuck in my left hand i had not time to move it it simply came and stuck ""
""oo ""
""i saw another catch like that it was done by ulyett a fine yorkshire
player--such a big upstanding fellow he was bowling and the
batsman--it was an australian in a test match--hit as hard as ever he
could ulyett could not have seen it but he just stuck out his hand and
there was the ball ""
""suppose it had hit his body ""
""well it would have hurt him ""
""would he have cried "" from dimples ""no boy that is what games are for to teach you to take a knock and
never show it supposing that--""
a step was heard coming along the passage ""good gracious boys here's mumty shut your eyes this moment it's
all right dear i spoke to them very severely and i think they are
nearly asleep ""
""what have you been talking about "" asked the lady ""cwicket "" cried dimples ""it's natural enough "" said daddy; ""of course when two boys--""
""three "" said the lady as she tucked up the little beds iii--speculations
the three children were sitting together in a bunch upon the rug in the
gloaming baby was talking so daddy behind his newspaper pricked up his
ears for the young lady was silent as a rule and every glimpse of her
little mind was of interest she was nursing the disreputable little
downy quilt which she called wriggly and much preferred to any of her
dolls ""i wonder if they will let wriggly into heaven "" she said the boys laughed they generally laughed at what baby said ""if they won't i won't go in either "" she added ""nor me neither if they don't let in my teddy-bear "" said dimples ""i'll tell them it is a nice clean blue wriggly "" said baby ""i love
my wriggly "" she cooed over it and hugged it ""what about that daddy "" asked laddie in his earnest fashion ""are
there toys in heaven do you think ""
""of course there are everything that can make children happy ""
""as many toys as in hamley's shop "" asked dimples ""more "" said daddy stoutly ""oo "" from all three ""daddy dear "" said laddie ""i've been wondering about the deluge ""
""yes dear what was it ""
""well the story about the ark all those animals were in the ark just
two of each for forty days wasn't that so ""
""that is the story ""
""well then what did the carnivorous animals eat ""
one should be honest with children and not put them off with ridiculous
explanations their questions about such matters are generally much more
sensible than their parents' replies ""well dear "" said daddy weighing his words ""these stories are very very old the jews put them in the bible but they got them from the
people in babylon and the people in babylon probably got them from some
one else away back in the beginning of things if a story gets passed
down like that one person adds a little and another adds a little and
so you never get things quite as they happened the jews put it in the
bible exactly as they heard it but it had been going about for thousands
of years before then ""
""so it was not true ""
""yes i think it was true i think there was a great flood and i think
that some people did escape and that they saved their beasts just as we
should try to save nigger and the monkstown cocks and hens if we were
flooded out then they were able to start again when the waters went
down and they were naturally very grateful to god for their escape ""
""what did the people who didn't escape think about it ""
""well we can't tell that ""
""they wouldn't be very grateful would they ""
""their time was come "" said daddy who was a bit of a fatalist ""i
expect it was the best thing ""
""it was jolly hard luck on noah being swallowed by a fish after all his
trouble "" said dimples ""silly ass it was jonah that was swallowed was it a whale daddy ""
""a whale why a whale couldn't swallow a herring ""
""a shark then ""
""well there again you have an old story which has got twisted and turned
a good deal no doubt he was a holy man who had some great escape at
sea and then the sailors and others who admired him invented this
wonder ""
""daddy "" said dimples suddenly ""should we do just the same as jesus
did ""
""yes dear; he was the noblest person that ever lived ""
""well did jesus lie down every day from twelve to one ""
""i don't know that he did ""
""well then i won't lie down from twelve to one ""
""if jesus had been a growing boy and had been ordered to lie down by his
mumty and the doctor i am sure he would have done so ""
""did he take malt extract ""
""he did what he was told my son--i am sure of that he was a good man so he must have been a good boy--perfect in all he did ""
""baby saw god yesterday "" remarked laddie casually daddy dropped his paper ""yes we made up our minds we would all lie on our backs and stare at the
sky until we saw god so we put the big rug on the lawn and then we all
lay down side by side and stared and stared i saw nothing and dimples
saw nothing but baby says she saw god ""
baby nodded in her wise way ""i saw him "" she said ""what was he like then ""
""oh just god ""
she would say no more but hugged her wriggly the lady had entered and listened with some trepidation to the frank
audacity of the children's views yet the very essence of faith was in
that audacity it was all so unquestionably real ""which is strongest daddy god or the devil "" it was laddie who was
speculating now ""why god rules everything of course ""
""then why doesn't he kill the devil ""
""and scalp him "" added dimples ""that would stop all trouble wouldn't it daddy ""
poor daddy was rather floored the lady came to his help ""if everything was good and easy in this world then there would be
nothing to fight against and so laddie our characters would never
improve ""
""it would be like a football match with all the players on one side ""
said daddy ""if there was nothing bad then nothing would be good for you would
have nothing to compare by "" added the lady ""well then "" said laddie with the remorseless logic of childhood ""if
that is so then the devil is very useful; so he can't be so very bad after all ""
""well i don't see that "" daddy answered ""our army can only show how
brave it is by fighting the german emperor but that does not prove that
the german emperor is a very nice person does it now ""besides "" daddy continued improving the occasion ""you must not think
of the devil as a person you must think of all the mean things one
could do and all the dirty things and all the cruel things and that is
really the devil you are fighting against you couldn't call them
useful could you ""
the children thought over this for a little ""daddy "" said laddie ""have _you_ ever seen god ""
""no my boy but i see his works i expect that is as near as we can
get in this world look at all the stars at night and think of the
power that made them and keeps each in its proper place ""
""he couldn't keep the shooting stars in their proper place "" said
dimples ""i expect he meant them to shoot "" said laddie ""suppose they all shot what jolly nights we should have "" cried dimples ""yes "" said laddie; ""but after one night they would all have gone and a
nice thing then ""
""well there's always the moon "" remarked dimples ""but daddy is it
true that god listens to all we say ""
""i don't know about that "" daddy answered cautiously you never know
into what trap those quick little wits may lead you the lady was more
rash or more orthodox ""yes dear he does hear all you say ""
""is he listenin' now ""
""yes dear ""
""well i call it vewy rude of him ""
daddy smiled and the lady gasped ""it isn't rude "" said laddie ""it is his duty and he _has_ to notice
what you are doing and saying daddy did you ever see a fairy ""
""no boy ""
""i saw one once ""
laddie is the very soul of truth quite painfully truthful in details so
that his quiet remark caused attention ""tell us about it dear ""
he described it with as little emotion as if it were a persian cat perhaps his perfect faith had indeed opened something to his vision ""it was in the day nursery there was a stool by the window the fairy
jumped on the stool and then down and went across the room ""
""what was it dressed like ""
""all in grey with a long cloak it was about as big as baby's doll i
could not see its arms for they were under the cloak ""
""did he look at you ""
""no he was sideways and i never really saw his face he had a little
cap that's the only fairy i ever saw of course there was father
christmas if you call him a fairy ""
""daddy was father christmas killed in the war ""
""no boy ""
""because he has never come since the war began i expect he is fightin'
the jarmans "" it was dimples who was talking ""last time he came "" said laddie ""daddy said one of his reindeers had
hurt its leg in the ruts of the monkstown lane perhaps that's why he
never comes ""
""he'll come all right after the war "" said daddy ""and he'll be redder
and whiter and jollier than ever "" then daddy clouded suddenly for he
thought of all those who would be missing when father christmas came
again ten loved ones were dead from that one household the lady put
out her hand for she always knew what daddy was thinking ""they will be there in spirit dear ""
""yes and the jolliest of the lot "" said daddy stoutly ""we'll have our
father christmas back and all will be well in england ""
""but what do they do in india "" asked laddie ""why what's wrong with them ""
""how do the sledge and the reindeer get across the sea all the parcels
must get wet ""
""yes dear there _have_ been several complaints "" said daddy gravely ""halloa here's nurse time's up off to bed ""
they got up resignedly for they were really very good children ""say
your prayers here before you go "" said the lady the three little
figures all knelt on the rug baby still cuddling her wriggly ""you pray laddie and the rest can join in ""
""god bless every one i love "" said the high clear child-voice ""and
make me a good boy and thank you so much for all the blessings of to-
day and please take care of alleyne who is fighting the germans and
uncle cosmo who is fighting the germans and uncle woodie who is
fighting the germans and all the others who are fighting the germans and the men on the ships on the sea and grandma and grandpa and uncle
pat and don't ever let daddy and mumty die that's all ""
""and please send plenty sugar for the poor people "" said baby in her
unexpected way ""and a little petrol for daddy "" said dimples ""amen "" said daddy and the little figures rose for the good-night kiss iv--the leatherskin tribe
""daddy "" said the elder boy ""have you seen wild indians ""
""yes boy ""
""have you ever scalped one ""
""good gracious no ""
""has one ever scalped you "" asked dimples ""silly "" said laddie ""if daddy had been scalped he wouldn't have all
that hair on his head--unless perhaps it grew again ""
""he has none hair on the very top "" said dimples hovering over the low
chair in which daddy was sitting ""they didn't scalp you did they daddy "" asked laddie with some
anxiety ""i expect nature will scalp me some of these days ""
both boys were keenly interested nature presented itself as some rival
chief ""when "" asked dimples eagerly with the evident intention of being
present daddy passed his fingers ruefully through his thinning locks ""pretty
soon i expect "" said he ""oo "" said the three children laddie was resentful and defiant but the
two younger ones were obviously delighted ""but i say daddy you said we should have an indian game after tea you
said it when you wanted us to be so quiet after breakfast you promised you know ""
it doesn't do to break a promise to children daddy rose somewhat
wearily from his comfortable chair and put his pipe on the mantelpiece first he held a conference in secret with uncle pat the most ingenious
of playmates then he returned to the children ""collect the tribe ""
said he ""there is a council in a quarter of an hour in the big room put on your indian dresses and arm yourselves the great chief will be
there ""
sure enough when he entered the big room a quarter of an hour later the
tribe of the leatherskins had assembled there were four of them for
little rosy cousin john from next door always came in for an indian game they had all indian dresses with high feathers and wooden clubs or
tomahawks daddy was in his usual untidy tweeds but carried a rifle he
was very serious when he entered the room for one should be very serious
in a real good indian game then he raised his rifle slowly over his
head in greeting and the four childish voices rang out in the war-cry it
was a prolonged wolfish howl which dimples had been known to offer to
teach elderly ladies in hotel corridors ""you can't be in our tribe
without it you know there is none body about now just try once if
you can do it "" at this moment there are half-a-dozen elderly people
wandering about england who have been made children once more by laddie
and dimples ""hail to the tribe "" cried daddy ""hail chief "" answered the voices ""red buffalo ""
""here "" cried laddie ""black bear ""
""here "" cried dimples ""white butterfly ""
""go on you silly squaw "" growled dimples ""here "" said baby ""prairie wolf ""
""here "" said little four-year-old john ""the muster is complete make a circle round the camp-fire and we shall
drink the firewater of the palefaces and smoke the pipe of peace ""
that was a fearsome joy the fire-water was ginger-ale drunk out of the
bottle which was gravely passed from hand to hand at no other time had
they ever drunk like that and it made an occasion of it which was
increased by the owlish gravity of daddy then he lit his pipe and it
was passed also from one tiny hand to another laddie taking a hearty
suck at it which set him coughing while baby only touched the end of
the amber with her little pink lips there was dead silence until it had
gone round and returned to its owner ""warriors of the leatherskins why have we come here "" asked daddy fingering his rifle ""humpty dumpty "" said little john and the children all began to laugh but the portentous gravity of daddy brought them back to the warrior
mood ""the prairie wolf has spoken truly "" said daddy ""a wicked paleface
called humpty dumpty has taken the prairies which once belonged to the
leatherskins and is now camped upon them and hunting our buffaloes what
shall be his fate let each warrior speak in turn ""
""tell him he has jolly well got to clear out "" said laddie ""that's not indian talk "" cried dimples with all his soul in the game ""kill him great chief--him and his squaw too "" the two younger
warriors merely laughed and little john repeated ""humpty dumpty ""
""quite right remember the villain's name "" said daddy ""now then the
whole tribe follows me on the war-trail and we shall teach this paleface
to shoot our buffaloes ""
""look here we don't want squaws "" cried dimples as baby toddled at the
rear of the procession ""you stay in the wigwam and cook ""
a piteous cry greeted the suggestion ""the white butterfly will come with us and bind up the wounds "" said
daddy ""the squaws are jolly good as torturers "" remarked laddie ""really daddy this strikes me as a most immoral game "" said the lady who had been a sympathetic spectator from a corner doubtful of the
ginger-ale horrified at the pipe and delighted at the complete
absorption of the children ""rather "" said the great chief with a sad relapse into the normal ""i
suppose that is why they love it so now then warriors we go forth on
the war-trail one whoop all together before we start capital follow
me now one behind the other not a sound if one gets separated from
the others let him give the cry of a night owl and the others will answer
with the squeak of the prairie lizard ""
""what sort of a squeak please ""
""oh any old squeak will do you don't walk indians trot on the war-
path if you see any man hiding in a bush kill him at once but don't
stop to scalp him--""
""really dear "" from the corner ""the great queen would rather that you scalp him now then all ready start ""
away went the line of figures daddy stooping with his rifle at the
trail laddie and dimples armed with axes and toy pistols as tense and
serious as any redskins could be the other two rather more
irresponsible but very much absorbed all the same the little line of
absurd figures wound in and out of the furniture and out on to the lawn and round the laurel bushes and into the yard and back to the clump of
trees there daddy stopped and held up his hand with a face that froze
the children ""are all here "" he asked ""yes yes ""
""hush warriors no sound there is an enemy scout in the bushes ahead stay with me you two you red buffalo and you black bear crawl
forward and settle him see that he makes no sound what you do must be
quick and sudden when all is clear give the cry of the wood-pigeon and
we will join you ""
the two warriors crawled off in most desperate earnest daddy leaned on
his gun and winked at the lady who still hovered fearfully in the
background like a dear hen whose chickens were doing wonderful and
unaccountable things the two younger indians slapped each other and
giggled presently there came the ""coo"" of a wood-pigeon from in front daddy and the tribe moved forward to where the advance guard were waiting
in the bushes ""great chief we could find no scout "" said laddie ""there was none person to kill "" added dimples the chief was not surprised since the scout had been entirely of his own
invention it would not do to admit it however ""have you found his trail "" he asked ""no chief ""
""let me look "" daddy hunted about with a look of preternatural sagacity
about him ""before the snows fell a man passed here with a red head grey clothes and a squint in his left eye his trail shows that his
brother has a grocer's shop and his wife smokes cigarettes on the sly ""
""oh daddy how could you read all that ""
""it's easy enough my son when you get the knack of it but look here we are indians on the war-trail and don't you forget it if you value
your scalp aha here is humpty dumpty's trail ""
uncle pat had laid down a paper trail from this point as daddy well
knew; so now the children were off like a little pack of eager harriers following in and out among the bushes presently they had a rest ""great chief why does a wicked paleface leave paper wherever he goes ""
daddy made a great effort ""he tears up the wicked letters he has written then he writes others
even wickeder and tears them up in turn you can see for yourself that
he leaves them wherever he goes now warriors come along ""
uncle pat had dodged all over the limited garden and the tribe followed
his trail finally they stopped at a gap in the hedge which leads into
the field there was a little wooden hut in the field where daddy used
to go and put up a printed cardboard: ""working "" he found it a very good
dodge when he wanted a quiet smoke and a nap usually there was nothing
else in the field but this time the chief pushed the whole tribe
hurriedly behind the hedge and whispered to them to look carefully out
between the branches in the middle of the field a tripod of sticks supported a kettle at
each side of it was a hunched-up figure in a coloured blanket uncle pat
had done his work skilfully and well ""you must get them before they can reach their rifles "" said the chief ""what about their horses black bear move down the hedge and bring back
word about their horses if you see none give three whistles ""
the whistles were soon heard and the warrior returned ""if the horses had been there what would you have done ""
""scalped them "" said dimples ""silly ass "" said laddie ""who ever heard of a horse's scalp you would
stampede them ""
""of course "" said the chief ""if ever you see a horse grazing you crawl
up to it spring on its back and then gallop away with your head looking
under its neck and only your foot to be seen don't you forget it but
we must scupper these rascals on our hunting-grounds ""
""shall we crawl up to them ""
""yes crawl up then when i give a whoop rush them take them alive i
wish to have a word with them first carry them into the hut go ""
away went the eager little figures the chubby babes and the two lithe active boys daddy stood behind the bush watching them they kept a
line and tip-toed along to the camp of the strangers then on the
chief's signal they burst into a cry and rushed wildly with waving
weapons into the camp of the palefaces a moment later the two pillow-
made trappers were being dragged off into the hut by the whooping
warriors they were up-ended in one corner when the chief entered and
the victorious indians were dancing about in front of them ""anybody wounded "" asked the chief ""no no ""
""have you tied their hands ""
with perfect gravity red buffalo made movements behind each of the
pillows ""they are tied great chief ""
""what shall we do with them ""
""cut off their heads "" shrieked dimples who was always the most
bloodthirsty of the tribe though in private life he had been known to
weep bitterly over a squashed caterpillar ""the proper thing is to tie them to a stake "" said laddie ""what do you mean by killing our buffaloes "" asked daddy severely the prisoners preserved a sulky silence ""shall i shoot the green one "" asked dimples presenting his wooden
pistol ""wait a bit "" said the chief ""we had best keep one as a hostage and
send the other back to say that unless the chief of the palefaces pays a
ransom within three days--""
but at that moment as a great romancer used to say a strange thing
happened there was the sound of a turning key and the whole tribe of
the leatherskins was locked into the hut a moment later a dreadful face
appeared at the window a face daubed with mud and overhung with grass which drooped down from under a soft cap the weird creature danced in
triumph and then stooped to set a light to some paper and shavings near
the window ""heavens "" cried the chief ""it is yellow snake the ferocious chief of
the bottlenoses ""
flame and smoke were rising outside it was excellently done and
perfectly safe but too much for the younger warriors the key turned the door opened and two tearful babes were in the arms of the kneeling
lady red buffalo and black bear were of sterner stuff ""i'm not frightened daddy "" said laddie though he looked a little pale ""nor me "" cried dimples hurrying to get out of the hut ""we'll lock the prisoners up with no food and have a council of war upon
them in the morning "" said the chief ""perhaps we've done enough
to-day ""
""i rather think you have "" said the lady as she soothed the poor little
sobbing figures ""that's the worst of having kids to play "" said dimples ""fancy having a
squaw in a war-party ""
""never mind we've had a jolly good indian game "" said laddie as the
sound of a distant bell called them all to the nursery tea _printed by hazell_ _watson & viney_ _ld _ _london and aylesbury_ _england_ footnotes:
