Chapter 1,"the prelude
 scene: _a plantation of thin young trees in a misty and rainy
 twilight; some woodland blossom showing the patches on the earth
 between the stems _
 the stranger _is discovered a cloaked figure with a pointed hood his costume might belong to modern or any other time and the
 conical hood is so drawn over the head that little can be seen of
 the face _
 _a distant voice a woman's is heard half-singing half-chanting unintelligible words the cloaked figure raises its head and
 listens with interest the song draws nearer and_ patricia carleon
 _enters she is dark and slight and has a dreamy expression though she is artistically dressed her hair is a little wild she
 has a broken branch of some flowering tree in her hand she does
 not notice the stranger and though he has watched her with
 interest makes no sign suddenly she perceives him and starts
 back _
patricia oh who are you stranger ah who am i [_commences to mutter to himself and maps out
the ground with his staff _]
 i have a hat but not to wear;
 i wear a sword but not to slay and ever in my bag i bear
 a pack of cards but not to play patricia what are you what are you saying stranger it is the language of the fairies o daughter of eve patricia but i never thought fairies were like you why you are taller
than i am stranger we are of such stature as we will but the elves grow small not large when they would mix with mortals patricia you mean they are beings greater than we are stranger daughter of men if you would see a fairy as he truly is look
for his head above all the stars and his feet amid the floors of the
sea old women have taught you that the fairies are too small to be
seen but i tell you the fairies are too mighty to be seen for they are
the elder gods before whom the giants were like pigmies they are the
elemental spirits and any one of them is larger than the world and you
look for them in acorns and on toadstools and wonder that you never see
them patricia but you come in the shape and size of a man stranger because i would speak with a woman patricia [_drawing back in awe _] i think you are growing taller as you
speak [_the scene appears to fade away and give place to the milieu of_
 act one _the duke's drawing-room an apartment with open french
 windows or any opening large enough to show a garden and one house
 fairly near it is evening and there is a red lamp lighted in the
 house beyond the_ rev cyril smith _is sitting with hat and
 umbrella beside him evidently a visitor he is a young man with
 the highest of high church dog-collars and all the qualities of a
 restrained fanatic he is one of the christian socialist sort and
 takes his priesthood seriously he is an honest man and not an
 ass _
[_to him enters_ mr hastings _with papers in his hand _
hastings oh good evening you are mr smith [_pause _] i mean you are
the rector i think smith i am the rector hastings i am the duke's secretary his grace asks me to say that he
hopes to see you very soon; but he is engaged just now with the doctor smith is the duke ill hastings [_laughing _] oh no; the doctor has come to ask him to help
some cause or other the duke is never ill smith is the doctor with him now hastings why strictly speaking he is not the doctor has gone over
the road to fetch a paper connected with his proposal but he hasn't far
to go as you can see that's his red lamp at the end of his grounds smith yes i know i am much obliged to you i will wait as long as is
necessary hastings [_cheerfully _] oh it won't be very long [_exit _
 [_enter by the garden doors_ dr grimthorpe _reading an open paper he is an old-fashioned practitioner very much of a gentleman and
 very carefully dressed in a slightly antiquated style he is about
 sixty years old and might have been a friend of huxley's _
doctor [_folding up the paper _] i beg your pardon sir i did not
notice there was anyone here smith [_amicably _] i beg yours a new clergyman cannot expect to be
expected i only came to see the duke about some local affairs doctor [_smiling _] and so oddly enough did i but i suppose we
should both like to get hold of him by a separate ear smith oh there's no disguise as far as i'm concerned i've joined this
league for starting a model public-house in the parish; and in plain
words i've come to ask his grace for a subscription to it doctor [_grimly _] and as it happens i have joined in the petition
against the erection of a model public-house in this parish the
similarity of our position grows with every instant smith yes i think we must have been twins doctor [_more good-humouredly _] well what is a model public-house do
you mean a toy smith i mean a place where englishmen can get decent drink and drink it
decently do you call that a toy doctor no; i should call that a conjuring trick or in apology to your
cloth i will say a miracle smith i accept the apology to my cloth i am doing my duty as a priest how can the church have a right to make men fast if she does not allow
them to feast doctor [_bitterly _] and when you have done feasting them you will
send them to me to be cured smith yes; and when you've done curing them you'll send them to me to
be buried doctor [_after a pause laughing _] well you have all the old
doctrines it is only fair you should have all the old jokes too smith [_laughing also _] by the way you call it a conjuring trick that
poor people should drink moderately doctor i call it a chemical discovery that alcohol is not a food smith you don't drink wine yourself doctor [_mildly startled _] drink wine well--what else is there to
drink smith so drinking decently is a conjuring trick that you can do anyhow doctor [_still good-humouredly _] well well let us hope so talking
about conjuring tricks there is to be conjuring and all kinds of things
here this afternoon smith conjuring indeed why is that _enter_ hastings _with a letter in each hand _
hastings his grace will be with you presently he asked me to deal with
the business matter first of all [_he gives a note to each of them _
smith [_turning eagerly to the_ doctor ] but this is rather splendid the duke's given £50 to the new public-house hastings the duke is very liberal [_collects papers _
doctor [_examining his cheque _] very but this is rather curious he
has also given £50 to the league for opposing the new public-house hastings the duke is very liberal-minded [_exit _
smith [_staring at his cheque _] liberal-minded absent-minded i
should call it doctor [_sitting down and lighting a cigar _] well yes the duke does
suffer a little from absence [_puts his cigar in his mouth and pulls
during the pause_] of mind he is all for compromise don't you know the
kind of man who when you talk to him about the five best breeds of dog always ends up by buying a mongrel the duke is the kindest of men and
always trying to please everybody he generally finishes by pleasing
nobody smith yes; i think i know the sort of thing doctor take this conjuring for instance you know the duke has two
wards who are to live with him now smith yes i heard something about a nephew and niece from ireland doctor the niece came from ireland some months ago but the nephew
comes back from america to-night [_he gets up abruptly and walks about
the room _] i think i will tell you all about it in spite of your
precious public-house you seem to me to be a sane man and i fancy i
shall want all the sane men i can get to-night smith [_rising also _] i am at your service do you know i rather
guessed you did not come here only to protest against my precious
public-house doctor [_striding about in subdued excitement _] well you guessed
right i was family physician to the duke's brother in ireland i knew
the family pretty well smith [_quietly _] i suppose you mean you knew something odd about the
family doctor well they saw fairies and things of that sort smith and i suppose to the medical mind seeing fairies means much the
same as seeing snakes doctor [_with a sour smile _] well they saw them in ireland i suppose
it's quite correct to see fairies in ireland it's like gambling at
monte carlo it's quite respectable but i do draw the line at their
seeing fairies in england i do object to their bringing their ghosts
and goblins and witches into the poor duke's own back garden and within
a yard of my own red lamp it shows a lack of tact smith but i do understand that the duke's nephew and niece see witches
and fairies between here and your lamp [_he walks to the garden window and looks out _
doctor well the nephew has been in america it stands to reason you
can't see fairies in america but there is this sort of superstition in
the family and i am not easy in my mind about the girl smith why what does she do doctor oh she wanders about the park and the woods in the evenings damp evenings for choice she calls it the celtic twilight i've no use
for the celtic twilight myself it has a tendency to get on the chest but what is worse she is always talking about meeting somebody some
elf or wizard or something i don't like it at all smith have you told the duke doctor [_with a grim smile _] oh yes i told the duke the result was
the conjurer smith [_with amazement _] the _conjurer_ doctor [_puts down his cigar in the ash-tray _] the duke is
indescribable he will be here presently and you shall judge for
yourself put two or three facts or ideas before him and the thing he
makes out of them is always something that seems to have nothing to do
with it tell any other human being about a girl dreaming of the fairies
and her practical brother from america and he would settle it in some
obvious way and satisfy some one: send her to america or let her have
her fairies in ireland now the duke thinks a conjurer would just meet
the case i suppose he vaguely thinks it would brighten things up and
somehow satisfy the believers' interest in supernatural things and the
unbelievers' interest in smart things as a matter of fact the
unbeliever thinks the conjurer's a fraud and the believer thinks he's a
fraud too the conjurer satisfies nobody that is why he satisfies the
duke [_enter the_ duke _with_ hastings _carrying papers the_ duke _is
 a healthy hearty man in tweeds with a rather wandering eye in
 the present state of the peerage it is necessary to explain that
 the_ duke _though an ass is a gentleman _
duke good-morning mr smith so sorry to have kept you waiting but
we're rather in a rush to-day [_turns to_ hastings _who has gone over
to a table with the papers _] you know mr carleon is coming this
afternoon hastings yes your grace his train will be in by now i have sent the
trap duke thank you [_turning to the other two _] my nephew dr grimthorpe morris you know miss carleon's brother from america i
hear he's been doing great things out there petrol or something must
move with the times eh doctor i'm afraid mr smith doesn't always agree with moving with the
times duke oh come come progress you know progress of course i know how
busy you are; you mustn't overwork yourself you know hastings was
telling me you laughed over those subscriptions of mine well well i
believe in looking at both sides of a question you know aspects as
old buffle called them aspects [_with an all-embracing gesture of the
arm _] you represent the tendency to drink in moderation and you do
good in _your_ way the doctor represents the tendency not to drink at
all; and he does good in _his_ way we can't be ancient britons you
know [_a prolonged and puzzled silence such as always follows the more
 abrupt of the_ duke's _associations or disassociations of thought _
smith [_at last faintly _] ancient britons doctor [_to_ smith _in a low voice _] don't bother it's only his
broad-mindedness duke [_with unabated cheerfulness _] i saw the place you're putting up
for it mr smith very good work very good work indeed art for the
people eh i particularly liked that woodwork over the west door--i'm
glad to see you're using the new sort of graining why it all
reminds one of the french revolution [_another silence as the_ duke _lounges alertly about the room_ smith _speaks to the_ doctor _in an undertone _
smith does it remind you of the french revolution doctor as much as of anything else his grace never reminds me of
anything [_a young and very high american voice is heard calling in the
 garden ""say could somebody see to one of these trunks ""_
 [mr hastings _goes out into the garden he returns with_ morris
 carleon _a very young man: hardly more than a boy but with very
 grown-up american dress and manners he is dark smallish and
 active; and the racial type under his americanism is irish _
morris [_humorously as he puts in his head at the window _] see here does a duke live here doctor [_who is nearest to him with great gravity _] yes only one morris i reckon he's the one i want anyhow i'm his nephew [_the_ duke _who is ruminating in the foreground with one eye
 rather off turns at the voice and shakes_ morris _warmly by the
 hand _
duke delighted to see you my dear boy i hear you've been doing very
well for yourself morris [_laughing _] well pretty well duke; and better still for paul
t vandam i guess i manage the old man's mines out in arizona you
know duke [_shaking his head sagaciously _] ah very go-ahead man very
go-ahead methods i'm told well i dare say he does a great deal of
good with his money and we can't go back to the spanish inquisition [_silence during which the three men look at each other _
morris [_abruptly _] and how's patricia duke [_a little hazily _] oh she's very well i think she [_he hesitates slightly _
morris [_smiling _] well then where's patricia [_there is a slightly embarrassed pause and the_ doctor _speaks _
doctor miss carleon is walking about the grounds i think [morris _goes to the garden doors and looks out _
morris it's a mighty chilly night to choose does my sister commonly
select such evenings to take the air--and the damp doctor [_after a pause _] if i may say so i quite agree with you i
have often taken the liberty of warning your sister against going out in
all weathers like this duke [_expansively waving his hands about _] the artist temperament what i always call the artistic temperament wordsworth you know and
all that [_silence _
morris [_staring _] all what duke [_continuing to lecture with enthusiasm _] why everything's
temperament you know it's her temperament to see the fairies it's my
temperament not to see the fairies why i've walked all round the
grounds twenty times and never saw a fairy well it's like that about
this wizard or whatever she calls it for her there is somebody there for us there would not be somebody there don't you see morris [_advancing excitedly _] somebody there what do you mean duke [_airily _] well you can't quite call it a man morris [_violently _] a man duke well as old buffle used to say what is a man morris [_with a strong rise of the american accent _] with your
permission duke i eliminate old buffle do you mean that anybody has
had the tarnation coolness to suggest that some man duke oh not a _man_ you know a magician something mythical you
know smith not a _man_ but a medicine man doctor [_grimly _] i am a medicine man morris and you don't look mythical doc [_he bites his finger and begins to pace restlessly up and down the
 room _
duke well you know the artistic temperament morris [_turning suddenly _] see here duke in most commercial ways
we're a pretty forward country in these moral ways we're content to be
a pretty backward country and if you ask me whether i like my sister
walking about the woods on a night like this well i don't duke i am afraid you americans aren't so advanced as i'd hoped why as
old buffle used to say [_as he speaks a distant voice is heard singing in the garden; it
 comes nearer and nearer and_ smith _turns suddenly to the_ doctor smith whose voice is that doctor it is no business of mine to decide morris [_walking to the window _] you need not trouble i know who it
is _enter_ patricia carleon
[_still agitated _] patricia where have you been patricia [_rather wearily _] oh in fairyland doctor [_genially _] and whereabouts is that patricia it's rather different from other places it's either nowhere
or it's wherever you are morris [_sharply _] has it any inhabitants patricia generally only two oneself and one's shadow but whether he
is my shadow or i am his shadow is never found out morris he who patricia [_seeming to understand his annoyance for the first time and
smiling _] oh you needn't get conventional about it morris he is not
a mortal morris what's his name patricia we have no names there you never really know anybody if you
know his name morris what does he look like patricia i have only met him in the twilight he seems robed in a long
cloak with a peaked cap or hood like the elves in my nursery stories sometimes when i look out of the window here i see him passing round
this house like a shadow; and see his pointed hood dark against the
sunset or the rising of the moon smith what does he talk about patricia he tells me the truth very many true things he is a wizard morris how do you know he's a wizard i suppose he plays some tricks on
you patricia i should know he was a wizard if he played no tricks but once
he stooped and picked up a stone and cast it into the air and it flew
up into god's heaven like a bird morris was that what first made you think he was a wizard patricia oh no when i first saw him he was tracing circles and
pentacles in the grass and talking the language of the elves morris [_sceptically _] do you know the language of the elves patricia not until i heard it morris [_lowering his voice as if for his sister but losing patience
so completely that he talks much louder than he imagines _] see here patricia i reckon this kind of thing is going to be the limit i'm just
not going to have you let in by some blamed tramp or fortune-teller
because you choose to read minor poetry about the fairies if this gipsy
or whatever he is troubles you again doctor [_putting his hand on_ morris's _shoulder _] come you must
allow a little more for poetry we can't all feed on nothing but petrol duke quite right quite right and being irish don't you know celtic as old buffle used to say charming songs you know about the irish
girl who has a plaid shawl--and a banshee [_sighs profoundly _] poor
old gladstone [_silence as usual _
smith [_speaking to_ doctor ] i thought you yourself considered the
family superstition bad for the health doctor i consider a family superstition is better for the health than a
family quarrel [_he walks casually across to_ patricia ] well it must
be nice to be young and still see all those stars and sunsets we old
buffers won't be too strict with you if your view of things sometimes
gets a bit--mixed up shall we say if the stars get loose about the
grass by mistake; or if once or twice the sunset gets into the east we should only say ""dream as much as you like dream for all mankind dream for us who can dream no longer but do not quite forget the
difference ""
patricia what difference doctor the difference between the things that are beautiful and the
things that are there that red lamp over my door isn't beautiful; but
it's there you might even come to be glad it is there when the stars
of gold and silver have faded i am an old man now but some men are
still glad to find my red star i do not say they are the wise men patricia [_somewhat affected _] yes i know you are good to everybody but don't you think there may be floating and spiritual stars which will
last longer than the red lamps smith [_with decision _] yes but they are fixed stars doctor the red lamp will last my time duke capital capital why it's like tennyson [_silence _] i remember
when i was an undergrad [_the red light disappears; no one sees it at first except_
 patricia _who points excitedly _
morris what's the matter patricia the red star is gone morris nonsense [_rushes to the garden doors _] it's only somebody
standing in front of it say duke there's somebody standing in the
garden patricia [_calmly _] i told you he walked about the garden morris if it's that fortune-teller of yours [_disappears into the garden followed by the_ doctor duke [_staring _] somebody in the garden really this land
campaign [_silence _
 [morris _reappears rather breathless _
morris a spry fellow your friend he slipped through my hands like a
shadow patricia i told you he was a shadow morris well i guess there's going to be a shadow hunt got a lantern duke patricia oh you need not trouble he will come if i call him [_she goes out into the garden and calls out some half-chanted and
 unintelligible words somewhat like the song preceding her
 entrance the red light reappears; and there is a slight sound as
 of fallen leaves shuffled by approaching feet the cloaked_
 stranger _with the pointed hood is seen standing outside the garden
 doors _
patricia you may enter all doors [_the figure comes into the room_
morris [_shutting the garden doors behind him _] now see here wizard we've got you and we know you're a fraud smith [_quietly _] pardon me i do not fancy that we know that for
myself i must confess to something of the doctor's agnosticism morris [_excited and turning almost with a snarl _] i didn't know you
parsons stuck up for any fables but your own smith i stick up for the thing every man has a right to perhaps the
only thing that every man has a right to morris and what is that smith the benefit of the doubt even your master the petroleum
millionaire has a right to that and i think he needs it more morris i don't think there's much doubt about the question minister i've met this sort of fellow often enough--the sort of fellow who
wheedles money out of girls by telling them he can make stones
disappear doctor [_to the_ stranger ] do you say you can make stones disappear stranger yes i can make stones disappear morris [_roughly _] i reckon you're the kind of tough who knows how to
make a watch and chain disappear stranger yes; i know how to make a watch and chain disappear morris and i should think you were pretty good at disappearing
yourself stranger i have done such a thing morris [_with a sneer _] will you disappear now stranger [_after reflection _] no i think i'll appear instead [_he
throws back his hood showing the head of an intellectual-looking man young but rather worn then he unfastens his cloak and throws it off emerging in complete modern evening dress he advances down the room
towards the_ duke _taking out his watch as he does so _] good-evening your grace i'm afraid i'm rather too early for the performance but
this gentleman [_with a gesture towards_ morris] seemed rather impatient
for it to begin duke [_rather at a loss _] oh good-evening why really--are you
the stranger [_bowing _] yes i am the conjurer [_there is general laughter except from_ patricia _as the others
 mingle in talk the_ stranger _goes up to her _
stranger [_very sadly _] i am very sorry i am not a wizard patricia i wish you were a thief instead stranger have i committed a worse crime than thieving patricia you have committed the cruellest crime i think that there
is stranger and what is the cruellest crime patricia stealing a child's toy stranger and what have i stolen patricia a fairy tale curtain"
Chapter 2,"act ii
 _the same room lighted more brilliantly an hour later in the
 evening on one side a table covered with packs of cards pyramids etc at which the_ conjurer _in evening dress is standing quietly
 setting out his tricks a little more in the foreground the_ duke;
 _and_ hastings _with a number of papers _
hastings there are only a few small matters here are the programmes of
the entertainment your grace wanted mr carleon wishes to see them very
much duke thanks thanks [_takes the programmes _]
hastings shall i carry them for your grace duke no no; i shan't forget i shan't forget why you've no idea how
businesslike i am we have to be you know [_vaguely _] i know you're a
bit of a socialist; but i assure you there's a good deal to do--stake
in the country and all that look at remembering faces now the king
never forgets faces [_waves the programmes about _] i never forget
faces [_catches sight of the_ conjurer _and genially draws him into the
discussion _] why the professor here who performs before the king
[_puts down the programmes_]--you see it on the caravans you
know--performs before the king almost every night i suppose conjurer [_smiling _] i sometimes let his majesty have an evening off and turn my attention of course to the very highest nobility but
naturally i have performed before every sovereign potentate white and
black there never was a conjurer who hadn't duke that's right that's right and you'll say with me that the great
business for a king is remembering people conjurer i should say it was remembering which people to remember duke well well now [_looks round rather wildly for something _]
being really businesslike hastings shall i take the programmes for your grace duke [_picking them up _] no no i shan't forget is there anything
else hastings i have to go down the village about the wire to stratford the
only other thing at all urgent is the militant vegetarians duke ah the militant vegetarians you've heard of them i'm sure won't obey the law [_to the_ conjurer] so long as the government serves
out meat conjurer let them be comforted there are a good many people who don't
get much meat duke well well i'm bound to say they're very enthusiastic advanced too--oh certainly advanced like joan of arc [_short silence in which the_ conjurer _stares at him _]
conjurer _was_ joan of arc a vegetarian duke oh well it's a very high ideal after all the sacredness of
life you know--the sacredness of life [_shakes his head _] but they
carry it too far they killed a policeman down in kent conjurer killed a policeman how vegetarian well i suppose it was so
long as they didn't eat him hastings they are asking only for small subscriptions indeed they
prefer to collect a large number of half-crowns to prove the popularity
of their movement but i should advise duke oh give them three shillings then hastings if i might suggest duke hang it all we gave the anti-vegetarians three shillings it
seems only fair hastings if i might suggest anything i think your grace will be wise
not to subscribe in this case the anti-vegetarians have already used
their funds to form gangs ostensibly to protect their own meetings and
if the vegetarians use theirs to break up the meetings--well it will
look rather funny that we have paid roughs on both sides it will be
rather difficult to explain when it comes before the magistrate duke but i shall be the magistrate [conjurer _stares at him again _]
that's the system my dear hastings that's the advantage of the system not a logical system--no rousseau in it--but see how well it works i
shall be the very best magistrate that could be on the bench the others
would be biassed you know old sir lawrence is a vegetarian himself;
and might be hard on the anti-vegetarian roughs colonel crashaw would
be sure to be hard on the vegetarian roughs but if i've paid both of
'em of course i shan't be hard on either of 'em--and there you have it just perfect impartiality hastings [_restrainedly _] shall i take the programmes your grace duke [_heartily _] no no; i won't forget 'em [_exit_ hastings ] well professor what's the news in the conjuring world conjurer i fear there is never any news in the conjuring world duke don't you have a newspaper or something everybody has a newspaper
now you know the--er--daily sword-swallower or that sort of thing conjurer no i have been a journalist myself; but i think journalism
and conjuring will always be incompatible duke incompatible--oh but that's where i differ--that's where i take
larger views larger laws as old buffle said nothing's _incompatible_ you know--except husband and wife and so on; you must talk to morris
about that it's wonderful the way incompatibility has gone forward in
the states conjurer i only mean that the two trades rest on opposite principles the whole point of being a conjurer is that you won't explain a thing
that has happened duke well and the journalist conjurer well the whole point of being a journalist is that you do
explain a thing that hasn't happened duke but you'll want somewhere to discuss the new tricks conjurer there are no new tricks and if there were we shouldn't want
'em discussed duke i'm afraid you're not _really_ advanced are you interested in
modern progress conjurer yes we are interested in all tricks done by illusion duke well well i must go and see how morris is pleasure of seeing
you later [_exit_ duke _leaving the programmes _
conjurer why are nice men such asses [_turns to arrange the table _]
that seems all right the pack of cards that is a pack of cards and the
pack of cards that isn't a pack of cards the hat that looks like a
gentleman's hat but which in reality is no gentleman's hat only my
hat; and i am not a gentleman i am only a conjurer and this is only a
conjurer's hat i could not take off this hat to a lady i can take
rabbits out of it goldfish out of it snakes out of it only i mustn't
take my own head out of it i suppose i'm a lower animal than a rabbit
or a snake anyhow they can get out of the conjurer's hat; and i can't i am a conjurer and nothing else but a conjurer unless i could show i
was something else and that would be worse [_he begins to dash the cards rather irregularly about the table enter_ patricia patricia [_coldly_] i beg your pardon i came to get some programmes my uncle wants them [_she walks swiftly across and takes up the programmes _
conjurer [_still dashing cards about the table _] miss carleon might i
speak to you a moment [_he puts his hands in his pockets stares at the
table; and his face assumes a sardonic expression _] the question is
purely practical patricia [_pausing at the door _] i can hardly imagine what the
question can be conjurer i am the question patricia and what have i to do with that conjurer you have everything to do with it i am the question: you patricia [_angrily _] well what am i conjurer you are the answer patricia the answer to what conjurer [_coming round to the front of the table and sitting against
it _] the answer to me you think i'm a liar because i walked about the
fields with you and said i could make stones disappear well so i can i'm a conjurer in mere point of fact it wasn't a lie but if it had
been a lie i should have told it just the same i would have told twenty
such lies you may or may not know why patricia i know nothing about such lies [_she puts her hand on the handle of the door but the_ conjurer _who is sitting on the table and staring at his boots does not
 notice the action and goes on as in a sincere soliloquy _
conjurer i don't know whether you have any notion of what it means to a
man like me to talk to a lady like you even on false pretences i am an
adventurer i am a blackguard if one can earn the title by being in all
the blackguard societies of the world i have thought everything out by
myself when i was a guttersnipe in fleet street or lower still a
journalist in fleet street before i met you i never guessed that rich
people ever thought at all well that is all i have to say we had some
good conversations didn't we i am a liar but i told you a great deal
of the truth [_he turns and resumes the arrangement of the table _
patricia [_thinking _] yes you did tell me a great deal of the truth you told me hundreds and thousands of truths but you never told me the
truth that one wants to know conjurer and what is that patricia [_turning back into the room _] you never told me the truth
about yourself you never told me you were only the conjurer conjurer i did not tell you that because i do not even know it i do
not know whether i am only the conjurer patricia what do you mean conjurer sometimes i am afraid i am something worse than the conjurer patricia [_seriously _] i cannot think of anything worse than a
conjurer who does not call himself a conjurer conjurer [_gloomily _] there is something worse [_rallying himself _]
but that is not what i want to say do you really find that very
unpardonable come let me put you a case never mind about whether it
is our case a man spends his time incessantly in going about in
third-class carriages to fifth-rate lodgings he has to make up new
tricks new patter new nonsense sometimes every night of his life mostly he has to do it in the beastly black cities of the midlands and
the north where he can't get out into the country now and again he
does it at some gentleman's country-house where he can get out into the
country well you know that actors and orators and all sorts of people
like to rehearse their effects in the open air if they can [_smiles _]
you know that story of the great statesman who was heard by his own
gardener saying as he paced the garden ""had i mr speaker received
the smallest intimation that i could be called upon to speak this
evening "" [patricia _controls a smile and he goes on with
overwhelming enthusiasm _] well conjurers are just the same it takes
some time to prepare an impromptu a man like that walks about the
woods and fields doing all his tricks beforehand and talking all sorts
of gibberish because he thinks he is alone one evening this man found
he was not alone he found a very beautiful child was watching him patricia a child conjurer yes that was his first impression he is an intimate friend
of mine i have known him all my life he tells me he has since
discovered she is not a child she does not fulfil the definition patricia what is the definition of a child conjurer somebody you can play with patricia [_abruptly _] why did you wear that cloak with the hood up conjurer [_smiling _] i think it escaped your notice that it was
raining patricia [_smiling faintly _] and what did this friend of yours do conjurer you have already told me what he did he destroyed a fairy
tale for he created a fairy tale that he was bound to destroy [_swinging round suddenly on the table _] but do you blame a man very
much miss carleon if he enjoyed the only fairy tale he had had in his
life suppose he said the silly circles he was drawing for practice
were really magic circles suppose he said the bosh he was talking was
the language of the elves remember he has read fairy tales as much as
you have fairy tales are the only democratic institutions all the
classes have heard all the fairy tales do you blame him very much if
he too tried to have a holiday in fairyland patricia [_simply _] i blame him less than i did but i still say there
can be nothing worse than false magic and after all it was he who
brought the false magic conjurer [_rising from his seat _] yes it was she who brought the real
magic [_enter_ morris _in evening-dress he walks straight up to the
 conjuring-table; and picks up one article after another putting
 each down with a comment _
morris i know that one i know that i know that let's see that's the
false bottom i think that works with a wire i know that; it goes up
the sleeve that's the false bottom again that's the substituted pack
of cards--that patricia really morris you mustn't talk as if you knew everything conjurer oh i don't mind anyone knowing everything miss carleon there is something that is much more important than knowing how a thing
is done morris and what's that conjurer knowing how to do it morris [_becoming nasal again in anger _] that's so eh being the
high-toned conjurer because you can't any longer take all the sidewalk
as a fairy patricia [_crossing the room and speaking seriously to her brother _]
really morris you are very rude and it's quite ridiculous to be rude this gentleman was only practising some tricks by himself in the garden [_with a certain dignity _] if there was any mistake it was mine come shake hands or whatever men do when they apologize don't be silly he
won't turn you into a bowl of goldfish morris [_reluctantly _] well i guess that's so [_offering his hand _]
shake [_they shake hands _] and you won't turn me into a bowl of
goldfish anyhow professor i understand that when you do produce a
bowl of goldfish they are generally slips of carrot that is so professor conjurer [_sharply _] yes [_produces a bowl of goldfish from his tail
pockets and holds it under the other's nose _] judge for yourself morris [_in monstrous excitement _] very good very good but i know
how that's done--i know how that's done you have an india-rubber cap you know or cover conjurer yes [_goes back gloomily to his table and sits on it picking up a pack
 of cards and balancing it in his hand _
morris ah most mysteries are tolerably plain if you know the
apparatus [_enter_ doctor _and_ smith _talking with grave faces but
growing silent as they reach the group _] i guess i wish we had all the
old apparatus of all the old priests and prophets since the beginning of
the world i guess most of the old miracles and that were a matter of
just panel and wires conjurer i don't quite understand you what old apparatus do you want
so much morris [_breaking out with all the frenzy of the young free-thinker _]
well sir i just want that old apparatus that turned rods into snakes i want those smart appliances sir that brought water out of a rock
when old man moses chose to hit it i guess it's a pity we've lost the
machinery i would like to have those old conjurers here that called
themselves patriarchs and prophets in your precious bible patricia morris you mustn't talk like that morris well i don't believe in religion doctor [_aside _] hush hush nobody but women believe in religion patricia [_humorously _] i think this is a fitting opportunity to show
you another ancient conjuring trick doctor which one is that patricia the vanishing lady [_exit_ patricia smith there is one part of their old apparatus i regret especially
being lost morris [_still excited _] yes smith the apparatus for writing the book of job morris well well they didn't know everything in those old times smith no and in those old times they knew they didn't [_dreamily _]
where shall wisdom be found and what is the place of understanding conjurer somewhere in america i believe smith [_still dreamily _] man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is
it found in the land of the living the deep sayeth it is not in me the
sea sayeth it is not with me death and destruction say we have heard
tell of it god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place
thereof for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the
whole heaven but to man he hath said: behold the fear of the lord that
is wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding [_turns suddenly to
the_ doctor ] how's that for agnosticism dr grimthorpe what a pity
that apparatus is lost morris well you may just smile how you choose i reckon but i say the
conjurer here could be the biggest man in the big blessed centuries if
he could just show us how the holy old tricks were done we must say
this for old man moses that he was in advance of his time when he did
the old tricks they were new tricks he got the pull on the public he
could do his tricks before grown men great bearded fighting men who
could win battles and sing psalms but this modern conjuring is all
behind the times that's why they only do it with schoolboys there
isn't a trick on that table i don't know the whole trade's as dead as
mutton; and not half so satisfying why he [_pointing to the_ conjurer]
brought out a bowl of goldfish just now--an old trick that anybody could
do conjurer oh i quite agree the apparatus is perfectly simple by the
way let me have a look at those goldfish of yours will you morris [_angrily _] i'm not a paid play-actor come here to conjure i'm
not here to do stale tricks; i'm here to see through 'em i say it's an
old trick and conjurer true but as you said we never show it except to schoolboys morris and may i ask you professor hocus pocus or whatever your name
is whom you are calling a schoolboy conjurer i beg your pardon your sister will tell you i am sometimes
mistaken about children morris i forbid you to appeal to my sister conjurer that is exactly what a schoolboy would do morris [_with abrupt and dangerous calm _] i am not a schoolboy professor i am a quiet business man but i tell you in the country i
come from the hand of a quiet business man goes to his hip pocket at an
insult like that conjurer [_fiercely _] let it go to his pocket i thought the hand of a
quiet business man more often went to someone else's pocket morris you [_puts his hand to his hip the_ doctor _puts his hand on his
 shoulder _
doctor gentlemen i think you are both forgetting yourselves conjurer perhaps [_his tone sinks suddenly to weariness _] i ask
pardon for what i said it was certainly in excess of the young
gentleman's deserts [_sighs _] i sometimes rather wish i could forget
myself morris [_sullenly after a pause _] well the entertainment's coming
on; and you english don't like a scene i reckon i'll have to bury the
blamed old hatchet too doctor [_with a certain dignity his social type shining through his
profession _] mr carleon you will forgive an old man who knew your
father well if he doubts whether you are doing yourself justice in
treating yourself as an american indian merely because you have lived
in america in my old friend huxley's time we of the middle classes
disbelieved in reason and all sorts of things but we did believe in
good manners it is a pity if the aristocracy can't i don't like to
hear you say you are a savage and have buried a tomahawk i would rather
hear you say as your irish ancestors would have said that you have
sheathed your sword with the dignity proper to a gentleman morris very well i've sheathed my sword with the dignity proper to a
gentleman conjurer and i have sheathed my sword with the dignity proper to a
conjurer morris how does the conjurer sheath a sword conjurer swallows it doctor then we all agree there shall be no quarrel smith may i say a word i have a great dislike of a quarrel for a
reason quite beyond my duty to my cloth morris and what is that smith i object to a quarrel because it always interrupts an argument may i bring you back for a moment to the argument you were saying that
these modern conjuring tricks are simply the old miracles when they have
once been found out but surely another view is possible when we speak
of things being sham we generally mean that they are imitations of
things that are genuine take that reynolds over there of the duke's
great-grandfather [_points to a picture on the wall _] if i were to say
it was a copy morris wal the duke's real amiable; but i reckon you'd find what you
call the interruption of an argument smith well suppose i did say so you wouldn't take it as meaning that
sir joshua reynolds never lived why should sham miracles prove to us
that real saints and prophets never lived there may be sham magic and
real magic also [_the_ conjurer _raises his head and listens with a strange air of
 intentness _
smith there may be turnip ghosts precisely because there are real
ghosts there may be theatrical fairies precisely because there are real
fairies you do not abolish the bank of england by pointing to a forged
bank-note morris i hope the professor enjoys being called a forged bank-note conjurer almost as much as being called the prospectus of some american
companies doctor gentlemen gentlemen conjurer i am sorry morris wal let's have the argument first then i guess we can have the
quarrel afterwards i'll clean this house of some encumbrances see
here mr smith i'm not putting anything on your real miracle notion i
say and science says that there's a cause for everything science will
find out that cause and sooner or later your old miracle will look
mighty mean sooner or later science will botanise a bit on your turnip
ghosts; and make you look turnips yourselves for having taken any i
say doctor [_in a low voice to_ smith ] i don't like this peaceful argument
of yours the boy is getting much too excited morris you say old man reynolds lived; and science don't say no [_he
turns excitedly to the picture _] but i guess he's dead now; and you'll
no more raise your saints and prophets from the dead than you'll raise
the duke's great-grandfather to dance on that wall [_the picture begins to sway slightly to and fro on the wall _
doctor why the picture is moving morris [_turning furiously on the_ conjurer ] you were in the room
before us do you reckon that will take us in you can do all that with
wires conjurer [_motionless and without looking up from the table _] yes i
could do all that with wires morris and you reckoned i shouldn't know [_laughs with a high crowing
laugh _] that's how the derned dirty spiritualists do all their tricks they say they can make the furniture move of itself if it does move
they move it; and we mean to know how [_a chair falls over with a slight crash _
 [morris _almost staggers and momentarily fights for breath and
 words _
morris you why that every one knows that a sliding
plank it can be done with a sliding plank conjurer [_without looking up _] yes it can be done with a sliding
plank [_the_ doctor _draws nearer to_ morris _who faces about addressing him passionately _
morris you were right on the spot doc when you talked about that red
lamp of yours that red lamp is the light of science that will put out
all the lanterns of your turnip ghosts it's a consuming fire doctor but it is the red light of the morning [_points at it in exalted
enthusiasm _] your priests can no more stop that light from shining or
change its colour and its radiance than joshua could stop the sun and
moon [_laughs savagely _] why a real fairy in an elfin cloak strayed
too near the lamp an hour or two ago; and it turned him into a common
society clown with a white tie [_the lamp at the end of the garden turns blue they all look at it
 in silence _
morris [_splitting the silence on a high unnatural note _] wait a bit wait a bit i've got you i'll have you [_he strides wildly up and
down the room biting his finger _] you put a wire no that can't be
it doctor [_speaking to him soothingly _] well well just at this moment
we need not inquire morris [_turning on him furiously _] you call yourself a man of
science and you dare to tell me not to inquire smith we only mean that for the moment you might let it alone morris [_violently _] no priest i will not let it alone [_pacing the
room again _] could it be done with mirrors [_he clasps his brow _] you
have a mirror [_suddenly with a shout _] i've got it i've got it mixture of lights why not if you throw a green light on a red
light [_sudden silence _
smith [_quietly to the_ doctor ] you don't get blue doctor [_stepping across to the_ conjurer ] if you have done this
trick for god's sake undo it [_after a silence the light turns red again _
morris [_dashing suddenly to the glass doors and examining them _] it's
the glass you've been doing something to the glass [_he stops suddenly and there is a long silence _
conjurer [_still without moving _] i don't think you will find anything
wrong with the glass morris [_bursting open the glass doors with a crash _] then i'll find
out what's wrong with the lamp [_disappears into the garden _
doctor it is still a wet night i am afraid smith yes and somebody else will be wandering about the garden now [_through the broken glass doors_ morris _can be seen marching
 backwards and forwards with swifter and swifter steps _
smith i suppose in this case the celtic twilight will not get on the
chest doctor oh if it were only the chest _enter_ patricia patricia where is my brother [_there is an embarrassed silence in which the_ conjurer
 _answers _
conjurer i am afraid he is walking about in fairyland patricia but he mustn't go out on a night like this; it's very
dangerous conjurer yes it is very dangerous he might meet a fairy patricia what do you mean conjurer you went out in this sort of weather and you met this sort of
fairy and so far it has only brought you sorrow patricia i am going out to find my brother [_she goes out into the garden through the open doors _
smith [_after a silence very suddenly _] what is that noise she is
not singing those songs to him is she conjurer no he does not understand the language of the elves smith but what are all those cries and gasps i hear conjurer the normal noises i believe of a quiet business man doctor sir i can understand your being bitter for i admit you have
been uncivilly received; but to speak like that just now [patricia _reappears at the garden doors very pale _
patricia can i speak to the doctor doctor my dear lady certainly shall i fetch the duke patricia i would prefer the doctor smith can i be of any use patricia i only want the doctor [_she goes out again followed by_ dr grimthorpe _the others look
 at each other _
smith [_quietly _] that last was a wonderful trick of yours conjurer thank you i suppose you mean it was the only one you didn't
see through smith something of the kind i confess your last trick was the best
trick i have ever seen it is so good that i wish you had not done it conjurer and so do i smith how do you mean do you wish you had never been a conjurer conjurer i wish i had never been born [_exit_ conjurer [_a silence the_ doctor _enters very grave _
doctor it is all right so far we have brought him back smith [_drawing near to him _] you told me there was mental trouble
with the girl doctor [_looking at him steadily _] no i told you there was mental
trouble in the family smith [_after a silence _] where is mr morris carleon doctor i have got him into bed in the next room his sister is looking
after him smith his sister oh then do you believe in fairies doctor believe in fairies what do you mean smith at least you put the person who does believe in them in charge of
the person who doesn't doctor well i suppose i do smith you don't think she'll keep him awake all night with fairy tales doctor certainly not smith you don't think she'll throw the medicine-bottle out of window
and administer--er--a dewdrop or anything of that sort or a
four-leaved clover say doctor no; of course not smith i only ask because you scientific men are a little hard on us
clergymen you don't believe in a priesthood; but you'll admit i'm more
really a priest than this conjurer is really a magician you've been
talking a lot about the bible and the higher criticism but even by the
higher criticism the bible is older than the language of the
elves--which was as far as i can make out invented this afternoon but
miss carleon believed in the wizard miss carleon believed in the
language of the elves and you put her in charge of an invalid without
a flicker of doubt: because you trust women doctor [_very seriously _] yes i trust women smith you trust a woman with the practical issues of life and death through sleepless hours when a shaking hand or an extra grain would
kill doctor yes smith but if the woman gets up to go to early service at my church you
call her weak-minded and say that nobody but women can believe in
religion doctor i should never call this woman weak-minded--no by god not even
if she went to church smith yet there are many as strong-minded who believe passionately in
going to church doctor weren't there as many who believed passionately in apollo smith and what harm came of believing in apollo and what a mass of
harm may have come of not believing in apollo does it never strike you
that doubt can be a madness as well be faith that asking questions may
be a disease as well as proclaiming doctrines you talk of religious
mania is there no such thing as irreligious mania is there no such
thing in the house at this moment doctor then you think no one should question at all smith [_with passion pointing to the next room _] i think _that_ is
what comes of questioning why can't you leave the universe alone and
let it mean what it likes why shouldn't the thunder be jupiter more
men have made themselves silly by wondering what the devil it was if it
wasn't jupiter doctor [_looking at him _] do you believe in your own religion smith [_returning the look equally steadily _] suppose i don't: i
should still be a fool to question it the child who doubts about santa
claus has insomnia the child who believes has a good night's rest doctor you are a pragmatist _enter_ duke _absent-mindedly _
smith that is what the lawyers call vulgar abuse but i do appeal to
practise here is a family over which you tell me a mental calamity
hovers here is the boy who questions everything and a girl who can
believe anything upon which has the curse fallen duke talking about the pragmatists i'm glad to hear ah very
forward movement i suppose roosevelt now [_silence _] well we move
you know we move first there was the missing link [_silence _] no _first_ there was protoplasm--and _then_ there was the missing link; and
magna carta and so on [_silence _] why look at the insurance act doctor i would rather not duke [_wagging a playful finger at him _] ah prejudice prejudice you
doctors you know well i never had any myself [_silence _
doctor [_breaking the silence in unusual exasperation _] any what duke [_firmly _] never had any marconis myself wouldn't touch 'em [_silence _] well i must speak to hastings [_exit_ duke _aimlessly _
doctor [_exploding _] well of all the [_turns to_ smith ] you
asked me just now which member of the family had inherited the family
madness smith yes; i did doctor [_in a low emphatic voice _] on my living soul i believe it
must be the duke curtain"
Chapter 3,"act iii
 _room partly darkened a table with a lamp on it and an empty
 chair from room next door faint and occasional sounds of the
 tossing or talking of the invalid _
 _enter_ doctor grimthorpe _with a rather careworn air and a
 medicine bottle in his hand he puts it on the table and sits down
 in the chair as if keeping a vigil _
 _enter_ conjurer _carrying his bag and cloaked for departure as he
 crosses the room the_ doctor _rises and calls after him _
doctor forgive me but may i detain you for one moment i suppose you
are aware that--[_he hesitates_] that there have been rather grave
developments in the case of illness which happened after your
performance i would not say of course because of your performance conjurer thank you doctor [_slightly encouraged but speaking very carefully _]
nevertheless mental excitement is necessarily an element of importance
in physiological troubles and your triumphs this evening were really so
extraordinary that i cannot pretend to dismiss them from my patient's
case he is at present in a state somewhat analogous to delirium but in
which he can still partially ask and answer questions the question he
continually asks is how you managed to do your last trick conjurer ah my last trick doctor now i was wondering whether we could make any arrangement which
would be fair to you in the matter would it be possible for you to give
me in confidence the means of satisfying this--this fixed idea he seems
to have got [_he hesitates again and picks his words more slowly _]
this special condition of semi-delirious disputation is a rare one and
connected in my experience with rather unfortunate cases conjurer [_looking at him steadily _] do you mean he is going mad doctor [_rather taken aback for the first time _] really you ask me an
unfair question i could not explain the fine shades of these things to
a layman and even if--if what you suggest were so i should have to
regard it as a professional secret conjurer [_still looking at him _] and don't you think you ask me a
rather unfair question dr grimthorpe if yours is a professional
secret is not mine a professional secret too if you may hide truth
from the world why may not i you don't tell your tricks i don't tell
my tricks doctor [_with some heat _] ours are not tricks conjurer [_reflectively _] ah no one can be sure of that till the
tricks are told doctor but the public can see a doctor's cures as plain as conjurer yes as plain as they saw the red lamp over his door this
evening doctor [_after a pause _] your secret of course would be strictly
kept by every one involved conjurer oh of course people in delirium always keep secrets
strictly doctor no one sees the patient but his sister and myself conjurer [_starts slightly _] yes his sister is she very anxious doctor [_in a lower voice _] what would you suppose [conjurer _throws himself into the chair his cloak slipping back
 from his evening dress he ruminates for a short space and then
 speaks _
conjurer doctor there are about a thousand reasons why i should not
tell you how i really did that trick but one will suffice because it
is the most practical of all doctor well and why shouldn't you tell me conjurer because you wouldn't believe me if i did [_a silence the_ doctor _looking at him curiously _
 [_enter the_ duke _with papers in his hand his usual gaiety of
 manner has a rather forced air owing to the fact that by some
 vague sick-room associations he walks as if on tip-toe and begins
 to speak in a sort of loud or shrill whisper this he fortunately
 forgets and falls into his more natural voice _
duke [_to_ conjurer ] so very kind of you to have waited professor i
expect dr grimthorpe has explained the little difficulty we are in
much better than i could nothing like the medical mind for a scientific
statement [_hazily _] look at ibsen [_silence _
doctor of course the professor feels considerable reluctance in the
matter he points out that his secrets are an essential part of his
profession duke of course of course tricks of the trade eh very proper of
course quite a case of _noblesse oblige_ [_silence _] but i dare say we
shall be able to find a way out of the matter [_he turns to the_
conjurer ] now my dear sir i hope you will not be offended if i say
that this ought to be a business matter we are asking you for a piece
of your professional work and knowledge and if i may have the pleasure
of writing you a cheque conjurer i thank your grace i have already received my cheque from
your secretary you will find it on the counterfoil just after the
cheque you so kindly gave to the society for the suppression of
conjuring duke now i don't want you to take it in that way i want you to take
it in a broader way free you know [_with an expansive gesture _]
modern and all that wonderful man bernard shaw [_silence _
doctor [_with a slight cough resuming _] if you feel any delicacy the
payment need not be made merely to you i quite respect your feelings in
the matter duke [_approvingly _] quite so quite so haven't you got a cause or
something everybody has a cause now you know conjurers' widows or
something of that kind conjurer [_with restraint _] no; i have no widows duke then something like a pension or annuity for any widows you
may--er--procure [_gaily opening his cheque-book and talking slang to
show there is no ill-feeling _] come let me call it a couple of thou [_the_ conjurer _takes the cheque and looks at it in a grave and
 doubtful way as he does so the_ rector _comes slowly into the
 room _
conjurer you would really be willing to pay a sum like this to know
the way i did that trick duke i would willingly pay much more doctor i think i explained to you that the case is serious conjurer [_more and more thoughtful _] you would pay much more [_suddenly _] but suppose i tell you the secret and you find there's
nothing in it doctor you mean that it's really quite simple why i should say that
that would be the best thing that could possibly happen a little
healthy laughter is the best possible thing for convalescence conjurer [_still looking gloomily at the cheque _] i do not think you
will laugh duke [_reasoning genially _] but as you say it is something quite
simple conjurer it is the simplest thing there is in the world that is why
you will not laugh doctor [_almost nervously _] why what do you mean what shall we do conjurer [_gravely _] you will disbelieve it doctor and why conjurer because it is so simple [_he springs suddenly to his feet the cheque still in his hand _] you ask me how i really did the last
trick i will tell you how i did the last trick i did it by magic [_the_ duke _and_ doctor _stare at him motionless; but the_ rev smith _starts and takes a step nearer the table the_ conjurer
 _pulls his cloak round his shoulders this gesture as of
 departure brings the_ doctor _to his feet _
doctor [_astonished and angry _] do you really mean that you take the
cheque and then tell us it was only magic conjurer [_pulling the cheque to pieces _] i tear the cheque and i
tell you it was only magic doctor [_with violent sincerity _] but hang it all there's no such
thing conjurer yes there is i wish to god i did not know that there is duke [_rising also _] why really magic conjurer [_contemptuously _] yes your grace one of those larger laws
you were telling us about [_he buttons his cloak up at his throat and takes up his bag as he
 does so the_ rev smith _steps between him and the door and stops
 him for a moment _
smith [_in a low voice _] one moment sir conjurer what do you want smith i want to apologize to you i mean on behalf of the company i
think it was wrong to offer you money i think it was more wrong to
mystify you with medical language and call the thing delirium i have
more respect for conjurer's patter than for doctor's patter they are
both meant to stupify; but yours only to stupify for a moment now i put
it to you in plain words and on plain human christian grounds here is a
poor boy who may be going mad suppose you had a son in such a position would you not expect people to tell you the whole truth if it could help
you conjurer yes and i have told you the whole truth go and find out if
it helps you [_turns again to go but more irresolutely _
smith you know quite well it will not help us conjurer why not smith you know quite well why not you are an honest man; and you have
said it yourself because he would not believe it conjurer [_with a sort of fury _] well does anybody believe it do you
believe it smith [_with great restraint _] your question is quite fair come let
us sit down and talk about it let me take your cloak conjurer i will take off my cloak when you take off your coat smith [_smiling _] why do you want me to fight conjurer [_violently _] i want you to be martyred i want you to _bear_
witness to your own creed i say these things are supernatural i say
this was done by a spirit the doctor does not believe me he is an
agnostic; and he knows everything the duke does not believe me; he
cannot believe anything so plain as a miracle but what the devil are
you for if you don't believe in a miracle what does your coat mean if
it doesn't mean that there is such a thing as the supernatural what
does your cursed collar mean if it doesn't mean that there is such a
thing as a spirit [_exasperated _] why the devil do you dress up like
that if you don't believe in it [_with violence _] or perhaps you don't
believe in devils smith i believe [_after a pause _] i wish i could believe conjurer yes i wish i could disbelieve [_enter_ patricia _pale and in the slight négligée of the amateur
 nurse _
patricia may i speak to the conjurer smith [_hastening forward _] you want the doctor patricia no the conjurer doctor are there any developments patricia i only want to speak to the conjurer [_they all withdraw either at the garden or the other doors _
 patricia _walks up to_ conjurer patricia you must tell me how you did the trick you will i know you
will o i know my poor brother was rude to you he's rude to everybody [_breaks down _] but he's such a little little boy conjurer i suppose you know there are things men never tell to women they are too horrible patricia yes and there are things women never tell to men they also
are too horrible i am here to hear them all conjurer do you really mean i may say anything i like however dark it
is however dreadful it is however damnable it is patricia i have gone through too much to be terrified now tell me the
very worst conjurer i will tell you the very worst i fell in love with you when i
first saw you [_sits down and crosses his legs _
patricia [_drawing back _] you told me i looked like a child and conjurer i told a lie patricia o; this is terrible conjurer i was in love i took an opportunity you believed quite
simply that i was a magician but i patricia it is terrible it is terrible i never believed you were a
magician conjurer [_astounded _] never believed i was a magician patricia i always knew you were a man conjurer [_doing whatever passionate things people do on the stage _] i
am a man and you are a woman and all the elves have gone to elfland and all the devils to hell and you and i will walk out of this great
vulgar house and be married every one is crazy in this house
to-night i think what am i saying as if _you_ could marry _me_ o my
god patricia this is the first time you have failed in courage conjurer what do you mean patricia i mean to draw your attention to the fact that you have
recently made an offer i accept it conjurer oh it's nonsense it's nonsense how can a man marry an
archangel let alone a lady my mother was a lady and she married a
dying fiddler who tramped the roads; and the mixture plays the cat and
banjo with my body and soul i can see my mother now cooking food in
dirtier and dirtier lodgings darning socks with weaker and weaker eyes
when she might have worn pearls by consenting to be a rational person patricia and she might have grown pearls by consenting to be an
oyster conjurer [_seriously _] there was little pleasure in her life patricia there is little a very little in everybody's the question
is what kind we can't turn life into a pleasure but we can choose
such pleasures as are worthy of us and our immortal souls your mother
chose and i have chosen conjurer [_staring _] immortal souls and i suppose if i knelt down
to worship you you and every one else would laugh patricia [_with a smile of perversity _] well i think this is a more
comfortable way [_she sits down suddenly beside him in a sort of
domestic way and goes on talking _] yes i'll do everything your mother
did not so well of course; i'll darn that conjurer's hat--does one
darn hats --and cook the conjurer's dinner by the way what is a
conjurer's dinner there's always the goldfish of course conjurer [_with a groan _] carrots patricia and of course now i come to think of it you can always take
rabbits out of the hat why what a cheap life it must be how do you
cook rabbits the duke is always talking about poached rabbits really we shall be as happy as is good for us we'll have confidence in each
other at least and no secrets i insist on knowing all the tricks conjurer i don't think i know whether i'm on my head or my heels patricia and now as we're going to be so confidential and comfortable you'll just tell me the real practical tricky little way you did that
last trick conjurer [_rising rigid with horror _] how i did that trick i did it
by devils [_turning furiously on_ patricia ] you could believe in
fairies can't you believe in devils patricia [_seriously _] no i can't believe in devils conjurer well this room is full of them patricia what does it all mean conjurer it only means that i have done what many men have done; but
few i think have thriven by [_he sits down and talks thoughtfully _]
i told you i had mixed with many queer sets of people among others i
mixed with those who pretend truly and falsely to do our tricks by the
aid of spirits i dabbled a little in table-rapping and table-turning but i soon had reason to give it up patricia why did you give it up conjurer it began by giving me headaches and i found that every
morning after a spiritualist _séance_ i had a queer feeling of lowness
and degradation of having been soiled; much like the feeling i
suppose that people have the morning after they have been drunk but i
happen to have what people call a strong head; and i have never been
really drunk patricia i am glad of that conjurer it hasn't been for want of trying but it wasn't long before
the spirits with whom i had been playing at table-turning did what i
think they generally do at the end of all such table-turning patricia what did they do conjurer they turned the tables they turned the tables upon me i
don't wonder at your believing in fairies as long as these things were
my servants they seemed to me like fairies when they tried to be my
masters i found they were not fairies i found the spirits with whom
i at least had come in contact were evil awfully unnaturally evil patricia did they say so conjurer don't talk of what they said i was a loose fellow but i had
not fallen so low as such things i resisted them; and after a pretty
bad time psychologically speaking i cut the connexion but they were
always tempting me to use the supernatural power i had got from them it was not very great but it was enough to move things about to alter
lights and so on i don't know whether you realize that it's rather a
strain on a man to drink bad coffee at a coffee-stall when he knows he
has just enough magic in him to make a bottle of champagne walk out of
an empty shop patricia i think you behaved very well conjurer [_bitterly _] and when i fell at last it was for nothing half
so clean and christian as champagne in black blind pride and anger and
all kinds of heathenry because of the impudence of a schoolboy i
called on the fiends and they obeyed patricia [_touches his arm _] poor fellow conjurer your goodness is the only goodness that never goes wrong patricia and what _are_ we to do with morris i--i believe you now my
dear but he--he will never believe conjurer there is no bigot like the atheist i must think [_walks towards the garden windows the other men reappear to
 arrest his movement _
doctor where are you going conjurer i am going to ask the god whose enemies i have served if i am
still worthy to save a child [_exit into garden he paces up and down exactly as_ morris _has
 done as he does so_ patricia _slowly goes out; and a long silence
 follows during which the remaining men stir and stamp very
 restlessly the darkness increases it is long before anyone
 speaks _
doctor [_abruptly _] remarkable man that conjurer clever man curious
man very curious man a kind of man you know lord bless us what's
that duke what's what eh what's what doctor i swear i heard a footstep _enter_ hastings _with papers _
duke why hastings--hastings--we thought you were a ghost you must
be--er--looking white or something hastings i have brought back the answer of the anti-vegetarians i
mean the vegetarians [_drops one or two papers _
duke why hastings you _are_ looking white hastings i ask your grace's pardon i had a slight shock on entering
the room doctor a shock what shock hastings it is the first time i think that your grace's work has been
disturbed by any private feelings of mine i shall not trouble your
grace with them it will not occur again [_exit_ hastings duke what an extraordinary fellow i wonder if [_suddenly stops speaking _
doctor [_after a long silence in a low voice to_ smith ] how do you
feel smith i feel i must have a window shut or i must have it open and i
don't know which it is [_another long silence _
smith [_crying out suddenly in the dark _] in god's name go doctor [_jumping up rather in a tremble _] really sir i am not used
to being spoken to smith it was not you whom i told to go doctor no [_pause _] but i think i will go this room is simply
horrible [_he marches towards the door _
duke [_jumping up and bustling about altering cards papers etc on
tables _] room horrible room horrible no no no [_begins to run
quicker round the room flapping his hands like fins _] only a little
crowded a little crowded and i don't seem to know all the people we
can't like everybody these large at-homes [_tumbles on to a chair _
conjurer [_reappearing at the garden doors _] go back to hell from
which i called you it is the last order i shall give doctor [_rising rather shakily _] and what are you going to do conjurer i am going to tell that poor little lad a lie i have found
in the garden what he did not find in the garden i have managed to
think of a natural explanation of that trick doctor [_warmly moved _] i think you are something like a great man can i take your explanation to him now conjurer [_grimly _] no thank you i will take it myself [_exit into the other room _
duke [_uneasily _] we all felt devilish queer just now wonderful
things there are in the world [_after a pause _] i suppose it's all
electricity [_silence as usual _
smith i think there has been more than electricity in all this _enter_ patricia _still pale but radiant _
patricia oh morris is ever so much better the conjurer has told him
such a good story of how the trick was done _enter_ conjurer duke professor we owe you a thousand thanks doctor really you have doubled your claim to originality smith it is much more marvellous to explain a miracle than to work a
miracle what was your explanation by the way conjurer i shall not tell you smith [_starting _] indeed why not conjurer because god and the demons and that immortal mystery that you
deny has been in this room to-night because you know it has been here because you have felt it here because you know the spirits as well as i
do and fear them as much as i do smith well conjurer because all this would not avail if i told you the lie i told
morris carleon about how i did that trick smith well conjurer you would believe it as he believed it you cannot think
[_pointing to the lamp_] how that trick could be done naturally i alone
found out how it could be done--after i had done it by magic but if i
tell you a natural way of doing it smith well conjurer half an hour after i have left this house you will be all
saying how it was done [conjurer _buttons up his cloak and advances to_ patricia conjurer good-bye patricia i shall not say good-bye patricia yes that fairy tale has really and truly come to an end [_looks at him a little in the old mystical manner _] it is very hard
for a fairy tale to come to an end if you leave it alone it lingers
everlastingly our fairy tale has come to an end in the only way a fairy
tale can come to an end the only way a fairy tale can leave off being a
fairy tale conjurer i don't understand you patricia it has come true curtain

_8^o with portrait in photogravure $1 50 net by mail $1 65_
the plays have been acted with great success by the abbey company and
have been highly extolled by appreciative audiences and an enthusiastic
press they are distinguished by a humor of unchallenged originality one of the plays in the collection ""coats "" depends for its plot upon
the rivalry of two editors each of whom has written an obituary notice
of the other the dialogue is full of crisp humor ""mcdonough's wife ""
another drama that appears in the volume is based on a legend and
explains how a whole town rendered honor against its will ""the bogie
men"" has as its underlying situation an amusing misunderstanding of two
chimney-sweeps the wit and absurdity of the dialogue are in lady
gregory's best vein ""damer's gold"" contains the story of a miser beset
by his gold-hungry relations their hopes and plans are upset by one
they had believed to be of the simple of the world but who confounds
the wisdom of the wise ""the full moon"" presents a little comedy enacted
on an irish railway station it is characterized by humor of an original
and delightful character and repartee that is distinctly clever g p putnam's sons

irish plays
by
lady gregory
lady gregory's name has become a household word in america and her works
should occupy an exclusive niche in every library mr george bernard
shaw in a recently published interview said lady gregory ""is the
greatest living irishwoman even in the plays of lady gregory penetrated as they are by that intense love of ireland which is
unintelligible to the many drunken blackguards with irish names who make
their nationality an excuse for their vices and their worthlessness there is no flattery of the irish; she writes about the irish as molière
wrote about the french having a talent curiously like molière ""
""the witchery of yeats the vivid imagination of synge the amusing
literalism mixed with the pronounced romance of their imitators have
their place and have been given their praise without stint but none of
these can compete with lady gregory for the quality of universality the
best beauty in lady gregory's art is its spontaneity it is never
forced she has read and dreamed and studied and slept and wakened
and worked and the great ideas that have come to her have been
nourished and trained till they have grown to be of great
stature ""--_chicago tribune _

grania
kincora
dervorgilla
_second series the tragic comedies_
the canavans
the white cockade
the deliverer
_2 vols each $1 50 net by mail $1 65_
lady gregory has preferred going for her material to the traditional
folk-history rather than to the authorized printed versions and she has
been able in so doing to make her plays more living one of these =kincora= telling of brian boru who reigned in the year 1000 evoked
such keen local interest that an old farmer travelled from the
neighborhood of kincora to see it acted in dublin the story of =grania= on which lady gregory has founded one of these
plays was taken entirely from tradition grania was a beautiful young
woman and was to have been married to finn the great leader of the
fenians; but before the marriage she went away from the bridegroom with
his handsome young kinsman diarmuid after many years when diarmuid
had died (and finn had a hand in his death) she went back to finn and
became his queen another of lady gregory's plays =the canavans= dealt with the stormy
times of queen elizabeth whose memory is a horror in ireland second
only to that of cromwell =the white cockade= is founded on a tradition of king james having escaped
from ireland after the battle of the boyne in a wine barrel the choice of folk history rather than written history gives a freshness
of treatment and elasticity of material which made the late j m synge
say that ""lady gregory's method had brought back the possibility of
writing historic plays ""
all these plays except =grania= which has not yet been staged have been
very successfully performed in ireland they are written in the dialect
of kiltartan which had already become familiar to leaders of lady
gregory's books g p putnam's sons
