CHAPTER XII _ ( Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler ) _ There is something to be said for life on board ship . It is peaceful . My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples , running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs , and the more painful sports of “ Brother Bill ” and Bolster Bar . What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me . But there are many fools in the world . One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way .
