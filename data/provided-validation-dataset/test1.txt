's right hand was ink-stained up to the second joint . It was clear that , too weak to hold a pen , Mr. Paynter had dipped his finger in the ink-pot and managed to scrawl these two words across the surface of the newspaper he held -- but the words themselves seemed utterly fantastic : _Yellow Jasmine_ -- just that and nothing more . `` Croftlands has a large quantity of yellow jasmine growing up its walls , and it was thought that this dying message had some reference to them , showing that the poor old man 's mind was wandering . Of course , the newspapers , agog for anything out of the common , took up the story hotly , calling it the Mystery of the Yellow Jasmine -- though in all probability the words are completely unimportant . '' `` They are unimportant , you say ? '' said Poirot . `` Well , doubtless , since you say so , it must be so . '' I regarded him dubiously , but I could detect no mockery in his eye . `` And then , '' I continued , `` there came the excitements of the inquest . '' `` This is where you lick your lips , I perceive . '' `` There was a certain amount of feeling evidenced against Dr. Quentin . To begin with , he was not the regular doctor , only a locum , putting in a month 's work , whilst Dr. Bolitho was away on a well-earned holiday . Then it was felt that his carelessness was the direct cause of the accident . But his evidence was little short of sensational . Mr. Paynter had been ailing in health ever since his arrival at Croftlands . Dr. Bolitho had attended him for some time , but when Dr. Quentin first saw his patient , he was mystified by some of the symptoms . He had only attended him once before the night when he was sent for after dinner . As soon as he was alone with Mr. Paynter , the latter had unfolded a surprising tale . To begin with , he was not feeling ill at all , he explained , but the taste of some curry that he had been eating at dinner had struck him as peculiar . Making an excuse to get rid of Ah Ling for a few minutes , he had turned the contents of his plate into a bowl , and he now handed it over to the doctor with injunctions to find out if there were really anything wrong with it . `` In spite of his statement that he was not feeling ill , the doctor noted that the shock of his suspicions had evidently affected him , and that his heart was feeling it . Accordingly he administered an injection -- not of a narcotic , but of strychnine . `` That , I think , completes the case -- except for _the_ crux of the whole thing -- the fact that the uneaten curry , duly analysed , was found to contain enough powdered opium to have killed two men ! '' I paused . `` And your conclusions , Hastings ? '' asked Poirot quietly . `` It 's difficult to say . It _might_ be an accident -- the fact that some one attempted to poison him the same night might be merely a coincidence . '' `` But you do n't think so ? You prefer to believe it -- murder ! '' `` Do n't you ? '' `` _Mon ami_ , you and I do not reason in the same way . I am not trying to make up my mind between two opposite solutions -- murder or accident -- that will come when we have solved the other problem -- the mystery of the 'Yellow Jasmine . ' By the way , you have left out something there . '' `` You mean the two lines at right angles to each other faintly indicated under the words ? I did not think they could be of any possible importance . '' `` What you think is always so important to yourself , Hastings . But let us pass from the mystery of the Yellow Jasmine to the Mystery of the Curry . '' `` I know . Who poisoned it ? Why ? There are a hundred questions one can ask . Ah Ling , of course , prepared it . But why should he wish to kill his master ? Is he a member of a _tong_ , or something like that . One reads of such things . The _tong_ of the Yellow Jasmine , perhaps . Then there is Gerald Paynter . '' I came to an abrupt pause . `` Yes , '' said Poirot , nodding his head . `` There is Gerald Paynter , as you say . He is his uncle 's heir . He was dining out that night , though . '' `` He might have got at some of the ingredients of the curry , '' I suggested . `` And he would take care to be out , so as not to have to partake of the dish . '' I think my reasoning rather impressed Poirot . He looked at me with a more respectful attention than he had given me so far . `` He returns late , '' I mused , pursuing a hypothetical case . `` Sees the light in his uncle 's study , enters , and , finding his plan has failed , thrusts the old man down into the fire . '' `` Mr. Paynter , who was a fairly hearty man of fifty-five , would not permit himself to be burnt to death without a struggle , Hastings . Such a reconstruction is not feasible . '' ``
