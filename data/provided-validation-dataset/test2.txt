he murmured . “ Poor Emily ! It is terrible. ” “ I do not think , monsieur , ” said Poirot pointedly , “ that you quite realize how terrible it may be—for you. ” And as Inglethorp did not appear to understand , he added : “ Mr . Inglethorp , you are standing in very grave danger. ” The two detectives fidgeted . I saw the official caution “ Anything you say will be used in evidence against you , ” actually hovering on Summerhaye ’ s lips . Poirot went on . “ Do you understand now , monsieur ? ” “ No . What do you mean ? ” “ I mean , ” said Poirot deliberately , “ that you are suspected of poisoning your wife. ” A little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking . “ Good heavens ! ” cried Inglethorp , starting up . “ What a monstrous idea ! _I_—poison my dearest Emily ! ” “ I do not think ” —Poirot watched him narrowly— “ that you quite realize the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest . Mr. Inglethorp , knowing what I have now told you , do you still refuse to say where you were at six o ’ clock on Monday afternoon ? ” With a groan , Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in his hands . Poirot approached and stood over him . “ Speak ! ” he cried menacingly . With an effort , Inglethorp raised his face from his hands . Then , slowly and deliberately , he shook his head . “ You will not speak ? ” “ No . I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say. ” Poirot nodded thoughtfully , like a man whose mind is made up . “ _Soit ! _ ” he said . “ Then I must speak for you. ” Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again . “ You ? How can you speak ? You do not know—— ” he broke off abruptly . Poirot turned to face us . “ _Mesdames_ and _messieurs_ ! I speak ! Listen ! I , Hercule Poirot , affirm that the man who entered the chemist ’ s shop , and purchased strychnine at six o ’ clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp , for at six o ’ clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm . I can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together , either at six or just after and , as you may know , the Abbey Farm , Mrs. Raikes ’ s home , is at least two and a half miles distant from the village . There is absolutely no question as to the alibi ! ” CHAPTER VIII . FRESH SUSPICIONS There was a moment ’ s stupefied silence . Japp , who was the least surprised of any of us , was the first to speak . “ My word , ” he cried , “ you ’ re the goods ! And no mistake , Mr. Poirot ! These witnesses of yours are all right , I suppose ? ” “ _Voilà ! _ I have prepared a list of them—names and addresses . You must see them , of course . But you will find it all right. ” “ I ’ m sure of that. ” Japp lowered his voice . “ I ’ m much obliged to you . A pretty mare ’ s nest arresting him would have been. ” He turned to Inglethorp . “ But , if you ’ ll excuse me , sir , why couldn ’ t you say all this at the inquest ? ” “ I will tell you why , ” interrupted Poirot . “ There was a certain rumour—— ” “ A most malicious and utterly untrue one , ” interrupted Alfred Inglethorp in an agitated voice . “ And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at present . Am I right ? ” “ Quite right. ” Inglethorp nodded . “ With my poor Emily not yet buried , can you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be started. ” “ Between you and me , sir , ” remarked Japp , “ I ’ d sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder . And I venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same . And , if it hadn ’ t been for Mr. Poirot here , arrested you would have been , as sure as eggs is eggs ! ” “ I was foolish , no doubt , ” murmured Inglethorp . “ But you do not know , inspector , how I have been persecuted and maligned. ” And he shot a baleful glance at Evelyn Howard . “ Now , sir , ” said Japp , turning briskly to John , “ I should like to see the lady ’ s bedroom , please , and after that I ’ ll have a little chat with the servants . Don ’ t you bother about anything . Mr. Poirot , here , will show me the way. ” As they all went out of the room , Poirot turned and made me a sign to follow him upstairs . There he caught me by the arm , and drew me aside . “ Quick , go to the other wing . Stand there—just this side of the baize door . Do not move till I come. ” Then , turning rapidly , he rejoined the two detectives . I followed his instructions , taking up my position by the baize door , and wondering what on
