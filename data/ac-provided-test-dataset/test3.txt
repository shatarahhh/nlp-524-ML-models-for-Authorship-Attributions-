on his heels . “ I understand it not , ” he growled . “ Who destroyed this ? And what was their object ? ” “ The Bakers ? ” I suggested . “ _Pourquoi ? _ Neither will makes any provision for them , and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital . How could it be to anyone ’ s advantage to destroy the will ? The hospitals benefit , yes ; but one can not suspect institutions ! ” “ Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself , ” I suggested . Poirot rose to his feet , dusting his knees with his usual care . “ That may be , ” he admitted . “ One of your more sensible observations , Hastings . Well , we can do no more here . We have done all that mortal man can do . We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh , but unfortunately his niece is no better off for our success. ” * * * * * By driving to the station at once , we were just able to catch a train to London , though not the principal express . Poirot was sad and dissatisfied . For my part , I was tired and dozed in a corner . Suddenly , as we were just moving out of Taunton , Poirot uttered a piercing squeal . “ _Vite_ , Hastings ! Awake and jump . But jump , I say ! ” Before I knew where I was , we were standing on the platform , bareheaded and minus our valises , while the train disappeared into the night . I was furious , but Poirot paid no attention . “ Imbecile that I have been ! ” he cried . “ Triple imbecile ! Not again will I vaunt my little gray cells ! ” “ That ’ s a good job , at any rate , ” I said grumpily . “ But what is this all about ? ” As usual , when following out his own ideas , he paid absolutely no attention to me . “ The tradesmen ’ s books , I have left them entirely out of account ! Yes , but where ? Where ? Never mind , I can not be mistaken . We must return at once. ” Easier said than done . We managed to get a slow train to Exeter , and there Poirot hired a car . We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the small hours of the morning . I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers when we had at last aroused them . Paying no attention to anybody , Poirot strode at once to the study . “ I have been , not a triple imbecile , but thirty-six times one , my friend , ” he deigned to remark . “ Now , behold ! ” Going straight to the desk , he drew out the key , and detached the envelope from it . I stared at him stupidly . How could he possibly hope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope ? With great care he cut open the envelope , laying it out flat . Then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame . In a few minutes faint characters began to appear . “ Look ! ” cried Poirot in triumph . I looked . There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece Violet Marsh . It was dated March 25 , twelve-thirty p. m. , and witnessed by Albert Pike , confectioner , and Jessie Pike , married woman . “ But is it legal ? ” I gasped . “ As far as I know , there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink . The intention of the testator is clear , and the beneficiary is his only living relation . But the cleverness of him ! He foresaw every step that a searcher would take , that I , miserable imbecile , took ! He gets two will-forms , makes the servants sign twice , then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope , and a fountain pen containing his little ink-mixture . On some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature ; then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself . If his niece sees through his little ruse , she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education and be thoroughly welcome to his money. ” “ She didn ’ t see through it , did she ? ” I said slowly . “ It seems rather unfair . The old man really won. ” “ But no , Hastings ! It is _your_ wits that go astray . Miss Marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands . Always employ the expert ! She has amply proved her right to the money. ” I wonder—I very much wonder what old Andrew Marsh would have thought !
