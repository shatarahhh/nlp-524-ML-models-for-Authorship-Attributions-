anthony cade signs on
“gentleman joe ”
“why if it isn’t old jimmy mcgrath ”
castle’s select tour represented by seven depressed-looking females
and three perspiring males looked on with considerable interest evidently their mr cade had met an old friend they all admired
mr cade so much his tall lean figure his sun-tanned face the
light-hearted manner with which he settled disputes and cajoled
them all into good temper this friend of his now—surely rather a
peculiar-looking man about the same height as mr cade but thickset
and not nearly so good-looking the sort of man one read about in
books who probably kept a saloon interesting though after all that
was what one came abroad for—to see all these peculiar things one read
about in books up to now they had been rather bored with bulawayo the sun was unbearably hot the hotel was uncomfortable there seemed
to be nowhere particular to go until the moment should arrive to motor
to the matoppos very fortunately mr cade had suggested picture
postcards there was an excellent supply of picture postcards anthony cade and his friend had stepped a little apart “what the hell are you doing with this pack of females ” demanded
mcgrath “starting a harem ”
“not with this little lot ” grinned anthony “have you taken a good
look at them ”
“i have that thought maybe you were losing your eyesight ”
“my eyesight’s as good as ever it was no this is a castle’s select
tour i’m castle—the local castle i mean ”
“what the hell made you take on a job like that ”
“a regrettable necessity for cash i can assure you it doesn’t suit my
temperament ”
jimmy grinned “never a hog for regular work were you ”
anthony ignored this aspersion “however something will turn up soon i expect ” he remarked
hopefully “it usually does ”
jimmy chuckled “if there’s any trouble brewing anthony cade is sure to be in it
sooner or later i know that ” he said “you’ve an absolute instinct
for rows—_and_ the nine lives of a cat when can we have a yarn
together ”
anthony sighed “i’ve got to take these cackling hens to see rhodes’s grave ”
“that’s the stuff ” said jimmy approvingly “they’ll come back bumped
black and blue with the ruts in the road and clamouring for bed
to rest the bruises on then you and i will have a spot or two and
exchange the news ”
“right so long jimmy ”
anthony rejoined his flock of sheep miss taylor the youngest and most
skittish of the party instantly attacked him “oh mr cade was that an old friend of yours ”
“it was miss taylor one of the friends of my blameless youth ”
miss taylor giggled “i thought he was such an interesting-looking man ”
“i’ll tell him you said so ”
“oh mr cade how can you be so naughty the very idea what was that
name he called you ”
“gentleman joe ”
“yes is your name joe ”
“i thought you knew it was anthony miss taylor ”
“oh go on with you ” cried miss taylor coquettishly anthony had by now well mastered his duties in addition to making the
necessary arrangements of travel they included soothing down irritable
old gentlemen when their dignity was ruffled seeing that elderly
matrons had ample opportunities to buy picture postcards and flirting
with everything under a catholic forty years of age the last task
was rendered easier for him by the extreme readiness of the ladies in
question to read a tender meaning into his most innocent remarks miss taylor returned to the attack “why does he call you joe then ”
“oh just because it isn’t my name ”
“and why gentleman joe ”
“the same kind of reason ”
“oh mr cade ” protested miss taylor much distressed “i’m sure you
shouldn’t say that papa was only saying last night what gentlemanly
manners you had ”
“very kind of your father i’m sure miss taylor ”
“and we are all agreed that you are quite the gentleman ”
“i’m overwhelmed ”
“no really i mean it ”
“kind hearts are more than coronets ” said anthony vaguely without a
notion of what he meant by the remark and wishing fervently it was
lunch time “that’s such a beautiful poem i always think do you know much poetry mr cade ”
“i might recite ‘the boy stood on the burning deck’ at a pinch ‘the
boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled ’ that’s all
i know but i can do that bit with action if you like ‘the boy stood
on the burning deck’—whoosh—whoosh—whoosh—(the flames you see)
‘whence all but he had fled’—for that bit i run to and fro like a dog ”
miss taylor screamed with laughter “oh do look at mr cade isn’t he funny ”
“time for morning tea ” said anthony briskly “come this way there is
an excellent café in the next street ”
“i presume ” said mrs caldicott in her deep voice “that the expense
is included in the tour ”
“morning tea mrs caldicott ” said anthony assuming his professional
manner “is an extra ”
“disgraceful ”
“life is full of trials isn’t it ” said anthony cheerfully mrs caldicott’s eyes gleamed and she remarked with the air of one
springing a mine:
“i suspected as much and in anticipation i poured off some tea into a
jug at breakfast this morning i can heat that up on the spirit lamp come father ”
mr and mrs caldicott sailed off triumphantly to the hotel the lady’s
back complacent with successful forethought “oh lord ” muttered anthony “what a lot of funny people it does take
to make a world ”
he marshalled the rest of the party in the direction of the café miss
taylor kept by his side and resumed her catechism “is it a long time since you saw your friend ”
“just over seven years ”
“was it in africa you knew him ”
“yes not this part though the first time i ever saw jimmy mcgrath he
was all trussed up ready for the cooking pot some of the tribes in the
interior are cannibals you know we got there just in time ”
“what happened ”
“very nice little shindy we potted some of the beggars and the rest
took to their heels ”
“oh mr cade what an adventurous life you must have led ”
“very peaceful i assure you ”
but it was clear that the lady did not believe him * * * * *
it was about ten o’clock that night when anthony cade walked into the
small room where jimmy mcgrath was busy manipulating various bottles “make it strong james ” he implored “i can tell you i need it ”
“i should think you did my boy i wouldn’t take on that job of yours
for anything ”
“show me another and i’ll jump out of it fast enough ”
mcgrath poured out his own drink tossed it off with a practised hand
and mixed a second one then he said slowly:
“are you in earnest about that old son ”
“about what ”
“chucking this job of yours if you could get another ”
“why you don’t mean to say that you’ve got a job going begging why
don’t you grab it yourself ”
“i have grabbed it—but i don’t much fancy it that’s why i’m trying to
pass it on to you ”
anthony became suspicious “what’s wrong with it they haven’t engaged you to teach in a sunday
school have they ”
“do you think anyone would choose me to teach in a sunday school ”
“not if they knew you well certainly ”
“it’s a perfectly good job—nothing wrong with it whatsoever ”
“not in south america by any lucky chance i’ve rather got my eye on
south america there’s a very tidy little revolution coming off in one
of those little republics soon ”
mcgrath grinned “you always were keen on revolutions—anything to be mixed up in a
really good row ”
“i feel my talents might be appreciated out there i tell you jimmy i can be jolly useful in a revolution—to one side or the other it’s
better than making an honest living any day ”
“i think i’ve heard that sentiment from you before my son no the job
isn’t in south america—it’s in england ”
“england return of hero to his native land after many long years they
can’t dun you for bills after seven years can they jimmy ”
“i don’t think so well are you on for hearing more about it ”
“i’m on all right the thing that worries me is why you’re not taking
it on yourself ”
“i’ll tell you i’m after gold anthony—far up in the interior ”
anthony whistled and looked at him “you’ve always been after gold jimmy ever since i knew you it’s your
weak spot—your own particular little hobby you’ve followed up more
wild-cat trails than anyone i know ”
“and in the end i’ll strike it you’ll see ”
“well every one his own hobby mine’s rows yours is gold ”
“i’ll tell you the whole story i suppose you know all about
herzoslovakia ”
anthony looked up sharply “herzoslovakia ” he said with a curious ring in his voice “yes know anything about it ”
there was quite an appreciable pause before anthony answered then he
said slowly:
“only what every one knows it’s one of the balkan states isn’t it principal rivers unknown principal mountains also unknown but
fairly numerous capital ekarest population chiefly brigands hobby assassinating kings and having revolutions last king nicholas iv assassinated about seven years ago since then it’s been a republic altogether a very likely spot you might have mentioned before that
herzoslovakia came into it ”
“it doesn’t except indirectly ”
anthony gazed at him more in sorrow than in anger “you ought to do something about this james ” he said “take a
correspondence course or something if you’d told a story like this in
the good old eastern days you’d have been hung up by the heels and
bastinadoed or something equally unpleasant ”
jimmy pursued his course quite unmoved by these strictures “ever heard of count stylptitch ”
“now you’re talking ” said anthony “many people who have never heard
of herzoslovakia would brighten at the mention of count stylptitch the grand old man of the balkans the greatest statesman of modern
times the biggest villain unhung the point of view all depends on
which newspaper you take in but be sure of this count stylptitch will
be remembered long after you and i are dust and ashes james every
move and counter move in the near east for the last twenty years has
had count stylptitch at the bottom of it he’s been a dictator and a
patriot and a statesman—and nobody knows exactly what he has been except that he’s been a perfect king of intrigue well what about him ”
“he was prime minister of herzoslovakia—that’s why i mentioned it
first ”
“you’ve no sense of proportion jimmy herzoslovakia is of no
importance at all compared to stylptitch it just provided him with a
birthplace and a post in public affairs but i thought he was dead ”
“so he is he died in paris about two months ago what i’m telling you
about happened some years ago ”
“the question is ” said anthony “what _are_ you telling me about ”
jimmy accepted the rebuke and hastened on “it was like this i was in paris—just four years ago to be exact i
was walking along one night in rather a lonely part when i saw half a
dozen french toughs beating up a respectable-looking old gentleman i
hate a one-sided show so i promptly butted in and proceeded to beat
up the toughs i guess they’d never been hit really hard before they
melted like snow ”
“good for you james ” said anthony softly “i’d like to have seen that
scrap ”
“oh it was nothing much ” said jimmy modestly “but the old boy was
no end grateful he’d had a couple no doubt about that but he was
sober enough to get my name and address out of me and he came along
and thanked me next day did the thing in style too it was then that i
found out it was count stylptitch i’d rescued he’d got a house up by
the bois ”
anthony nodded “yes stylptitch went to live in paris after the assassination of king
nicholas they wanted him to come back and be president later but he
wasn’t taking any he remained sound to his monarchical principals though he was reported to have his finger in all the backstairs pies
that went on in the balkans very deep the late count stylptitch ”
“nicholas iv was the man who had a funny taste in wives wasn’t he ”
said jimmy suddenly “yes ” said anthony “and it did for him too poor beggar she was some
little guttersnipe of a music hall artiste in paris—not even suitable
for a morganatic alliance but nicholas had a frightful crush on her and she was all out for being a queen sounds fantastic but they
managed it somehow called her the countess popoffsky or something and pretended she had romanoff blood in her veins nicholas married her
in the cathedral at ekarest with a couple of unwilling arch-bishops to
do the job and she was crowned as queen varaga nicholas squared his
ministers and i suppose he thought that was all that mattered—but
he forgot to reckon with the populace they’re very aristocratic and
reactionary in herzoslovakia they like their kings and queens to be
the genuine article there were mutterings and discontent and the
usual ruthless suppressions and the final uprising which stormed the
palace murdered the king and queen and proclaimed a republic it’s
been a republic ever since—but things still manage to be pretty lively
there so i’ve heard they’ve assassinated a president or two just to
keep their hand in but _revenons à nos moutons_ you had got to where
count stylptitch was hailing you as his preserver ”
“yes well that was the end of that business i came back to
africa and never thought of it again until about two weeks ago i
got a queer-looking parcel which had been following me all over the
place for the lord knows how long i’d seen in a paper that count
stylptitch had recently died in paris well this parcel contained his
memoirs—or reminiscences or whatever you call the things there was
a note enclosed to the effect that if i delivered the manuscript at a
certain firm of publishers in london on or before october 13 they were
instructed to hand me a thousand pounds ”
“a thousand pounds did you say a thousand pounds jimmy ”
“i did my son i hope to god it’s not a hoax put not your trust in
princes or politicians as the saying goes well there it is owing
to the way the manuscript had been following me around i had no time
to lose it was a pity all the same i’d just fixed up this trip to
the interior and i’d set my heart on going i shan’t get such a good
chance again ”
“you’re incurable jimmy a thousand pounds in the hand is worth a lot
of mythical gold ”
“and supposing it’s all a hoax anyway here i am passage booked and
everything on the way to cape town—and then you blow along ”
anthony got up and lit a cigarette “i begin to perceive your drift james you go gold hunting as planned and i collect the thousand pounds for you how much do i get out of it ”
“what do you say to a quarter ”
“two hundred and fifty pounds free of income tax as the saying goes ”
“that’s it ”
“done and just to make you gnash your teeth i’ll tell you that i would
have gone for a hundred let me tell you james mcgrath _you_ won’t
die in your bed counting up your bank balance ”
“anyway it’s a deal ”
“it’s a deal all right i’m on and confusion to castle’s select tours ”
they drank the toast solemnly "
Chapter 2,"2
a lady in distress
“so that’s that ” said anthony finishing off his glass and replacing
it on the table “what boat were you going on ”
“_granarth castle _”
“passage booked in your name i suppose so i’d better travel as james
mcgrath we’ve outgrown the passport business haven’t we ”
“no odds either way you and i are totally unlike but we’d probably
have the same description on one of those blinking things height 6
feet hair brown eyes blue nose ordinary chin ordinary——”
“not so much of this ‘ordinary’ stunt let me tell you that castle’s
selected me out of several applicants solely on account of my pleasing
appearance and nice manners ”
jimmy grinned “i noticed your manners this morning ”
“the devil you did ”
anthony rose and paced up and down the room his brow was slightly
wrinkled and it was some minutes before he spoke “jimmy ” he said at last “stylptitch died in paris what’s the point
of sending a manuscript from paris to london via africa ”
jimmy shook his head helplessly “i don’t know ”
“why not do it up in a nice little parcel and send it by post ”
“sounds a damn sight more sensible i agree ”
“of course ” continued anthony “i know that kings and queens and
government officials are prevented by etiquette from doing anything
in a simple straightforward fashion hence king’s messengers and all
that in medieval days you gave a fellow a signet ring as a sort of
open sesame ‘the king’s ring pass my lord ’ and usually it was the
other fellow who had stolen it i always wonder why some bright lad
never hit on the expedient of copying the ring—making a dozen or so and selling them at a hundred ducats apiece they seem to have had no
initiative in the middle ages ”
jimmy yawned “my remarks on the middle ages don’t seem to amuse you let us get back
to count stylptitch from france to england via africa seems a bit
thick even for a diplomatic personage if he merely wanted to ensure
that you should get a thousand pounds he could have left it you in his
will thank god neither you nor i are too proud to accept a legacy stylptitch must have been balmy ”
“you’d think so wouldn’t you ”
anthony frowned and continued his pacing “have you read the thing at all ” he asked suddenly “read what ”
“the manuscript ”
“good lord no what do you think i want to read a thing of that kind
for ”
anthony smiled “i just wondered that’s all you know a lot of trouble has been
caused by memoirs indiscreet revelations that sort of thing people
who have been closed as an oyster all their lives seem positively
to relish causing trouble when they themselves shall be comfortably
dead it gives them a kind of malicious glee jimmy what sort of a
man was count stylptitch you met him and talked to him and you’re a
pretty good judge of raw human nature could you imagine him being a
vindictive old devil ”
jimmy shook his head “it’s difficult to tell you see that first night he was distinctly
canned and the next day he was just a high-toned old boy with the most
beautiful manners overwhelming me with compliments till i didn’t know
where to look ”
“and he didn’t say anything interesting when he was drunk ”
jimmy cast his mind back wrinkling his brows as he did so “he said he knew where the koh-i-noor was ” he volunteered doubtfully “oh well ” said anthony “we all know that they keep it in the
tower don’t they behind thick plate glass and iron bars with a lot
of gentlemen in fancy dress standing round to see you don’t pinch
anything ”
“that’s right ” agreed jimmy “did stylptitch say anything else of the same kind that he knew which
city the wallace collection was in for instance ”
jimmy shook his head “h’m ” said anthony he lit another cigarette and once more began pacing up and down the
room “you never read the papers i suppose you heathen ” he threw out
presently “not very often ” said mcgrath simply “they’re not about anything that
interests me as a rule ”
“thank heaven i’m more civilized there have been several mentions of
herzoslovakia lately hints at a royalist restoration ”
“nicholas iv didn’t leave a son ” said jimmy “but i don’t suppose for
a minute that the obolovitch dynasty is extinct there are probably
shoals of young ’uns knocking about cousins and second cousins and
third cousins once removed ”
“so that there wouldn’t be any difficulty in finding a king ”
“not in the least i should say ” replied jimmy “you know i
don’t wonder at their getting tired of republican institutions a
full-blooded virile people like that must find it awfully tame to pot
at presidents after being used to kings and talking of kings that
reminds me of something else old stylptitch let out that night he said
he knew the gang that was after him they were king victor’s people he
said ”
“what ” anthony wheeled round suddenly a slow grin widened on mcgrath’s face “just a mite excited aren’t you gentleman joe ” he drawled “don’t be an ass jimmy you’ve just said something rather important ”
he went over to the window and stood there looking out “who is this king victor anyway ” demanded jimmy “another balkan
monarch ”
“no ” said anthony slowly “he isn’t that kind of a king ”
“what is he then ”
there was a pause and then anthony spoke “he’s a crook jimmy the most notorious jewel thief in the world a
fantastic daring fellow not to be daunted by anything king victor
was the nickname he was known by in paris paris was the headquarters
of his gang they caught him there and put him away for seven years on
a minor charge they couldn’t prove the more important things against
him he’ll be out soon—or he may be out already ”
“do you think count stylptitch had anything to do with putting him
away was that why the gang went for him out of revenge ”
“i don’t know ” said anthony “it doesn’t seem likely on the face of
it king victor never stole the crown jewels of herzoslovakia as far
as i’ve heard but the whole thing seems rather suggestive doesn’t
it the death of stylptitch the memoirs and the rumours in the
papers—all vague but interesting and there’s a further rumour to the
effect that they’ve found oil in herzoslovakia i’ve a feeling in my
bones james that people are getting ready to be interested in that
unimportant little country ”
“what sort of people ”
“financiers in city offices ”
“what are you driving at with all this ”
“trying to make an easy job difficult that’s all ”
“you can’t pretend there’s going to be any difficulty in handing over a
simple manuscript at a publisher’s office ”
“no ” said anthony regretfully “i don’t suppose there’ll be anything
difficult about that but shall i tell you james where i propose to
go with my £250 ”
“south america ”
“no my lad herzoslovakia i shall stand in with the republic i
think very probably i shall end up as president ”
“why not announce yourself as the principal obolovitch and be a king
whilst you’re about it ”
“no jimmy kings are for life presidents only take on the job for
four years or so it would quite amuse me to govern a kingdom like
herzoslovakia for four years ”
“the average for kings is even less i should say ” interpolated jimmy “it will probably be a serious temptation to me to embezzle your share
of the thousand pounds you won’t want it you know when you get back
weighed down with nuggets i’ll invest it for you in herzoslovakian oil
shares you know james the more i think of it the more pleased i am
with this idea of yours i should never have thought of herzoslovakia
if you hadn’t mentioned it i shall spend one day in london collecting
the booty and then away by the balkan express ”
“you won’t get off quite as fast as that i didn’t mention it before but i’ve got another little commission for you ”
anthony sank into a chair and eyed him severely “i knew all along that you were keeping something dark this is where
the catch comes in ”
“not a bit it’s just something that’s got to be done to help a lady ”
“once and for all james i refuse to be mixed up in your beastly love
affairs ”
“it’s not a love affair i’ve never seen the woman i’ll tell you the
whole story ”
“if i’ve got to listen to more of your long rambling stories i shall
have to have another drink ”
his host complied hospitably with this demand then began the tale “it was when i was up in uganda there was a dago there whose life i
had saved——”
“if i were you jimmy i should write a short book entitled ‘lives i
have saved ’ this is the second i’ve heard of this evening ”
“oh well i didn’t really do anything this time just pulled the dago
out of the river like all dagos he couldn’t swim ”
“wait a minute has this story anything to do with the other business ”
“nothing whatever though oddly enough now i remember it the man was
a herzoslovakian we always called him dutch pedro though ”
anthony nodded indifferently “any name’s good enough for a dago ” he remarked “get on with the good
work james ”
“well the fellow was sort of grateful about it hung around like a
dog about six months later he died of fever i was with him last
thing just as he was pegging out he beckoned me and whispered some
excited jargon about a secret—a gold mine i thought he said shoved
an oilskin packet into my hand which he’d always worn next his skin well i didn’t think much of it at the time it wasn’t until a week
afterwards that i opened the packet then i was curious i must
confess i shouldn’t have thought that dutch pedro would have had the
sense to know a gold mine when he saw it—but there’s no accounting for
luck——”
“and at the mere thought of gold your heart beat pitter-pat as
always ” interrupted anthony “i was never so disgusted in my life gold mine indeed i daresay it
may have been a gold mine to him the dirty dog do you know what it
was a woman’s letters—yes a woman’s letters and an englishwoman at
that the skunk had been blackmailing her—and he had the impudence to
pass on his dirty bag of tricks to me ”
“i like to see your righteous heat james but let me point out to
you that dagos will be dagos he meant well you had saved his life he bequeathed to you a profitable source of raising money—your
high-minded british ideals did not enter his horizon ”
“well what the hell was i to do with the things burn ’em that’s what
i thought at first and then it occurred to me that there would be that
poor dame not knowing they’d be destroyed and always living in a
quake and a dread lest that dago should turn up again one day ”
“you’ve more imagination than i gave you credit for jimmy ” observed
anthony lighting a cigarette “i admit that the case presented more
difficulties than were at first apparent what about just sending them
to her by post ”
“like all women she’d put no date and no address on most of the
letters there was a kind of address on one—just one word chimneys ”
anthony paused in the act of blowing out his match and he dropped it
with a quick jerk of the wrist as it burned his finger “chimneys ” he said “that’s rather extraordinary ”
“why do you know it ”
“it’s one of the stately homes of england my dear james a place
where kings and queens go for weekends and diplomatists forgather and
diplome ”
“that’s one of the reasons why i’m so glad that you’re going to england
instead of me you know all these things ” said jimmy simply “a josser
like myself from the backwoods of canada would be making all sorts of
bloomers but some one like you who’s been to eton and harrow——”
“only one of them ” said anthony modestly “will be able to carry it through why didn’t i send them to her you
say well it seemed to me dangerous from what i could make out she
seemed to have a jealous husband suppose he opened the letter by
mistake where would the poor dame be then or she might be dead—the
letters looked as though they’d been written some time as i figured it
out the only thing was for some one to take them to england and put
them into her own hands ”
anthony threw away his cigarette and coming across to his friend
clapped him affectionately on the back “you’re a real knight-errant jimmy ” he said “and the backwoods of
canada should be proud of you i shan’t do the job half as prettily as
you would ”
“you’ll take it on then ”
“of course ”
mcgrath rose and going across to a drawer took out a bundle of letters
and threw them on the table “here you are you’d better have a look at them ”
“is it necessary on the whole i’d rather not ”
“well from what you say about this chimneys place she may have been
staying there only we’d better look through the letters and see if
there’s any clue as to where she really hangs out ”
“i suppose you’re right ”
they went through the letters carefully but without finding what they
had hoped to find anthony gathered them up again thoughtfully “poor little devil ” he remarked “she was scared stiff ”
jimmy nodded “do you think you’ll be able to find her all right ” he asked
anxiously “i won’t leave england till i have you’re very concerned about this
unknown lady james ”
jimmy ran his finger thoughtfully over the signature “it’s a pretty name ” he said apologetically “_virginia revel _”"
Chapter 3,"3
anxiety in high places
“quite so my dear fellow quite so ” said lord caterham he had used the same words three times already each time in the hope
that they would end the interview and permit him to escape he disliked
very much being forced to stand on the steps of the exclusive london
club to which he belonged and listen to the interminable eloquence of
the hon george lomax clement edward alistair brent ninth marquis of caterham was a small
gentleman shabbily dressed and entirely unlike the popular conception
of a marquis he had faded blue eyes a thin melancholy nose and a
vague but courteous manner the principal misfortune of lord caterham’s life was to have succeeded
his brother the eighth marquis four years ago for the previous lord
caterham had been a man of mark a household word all over england at
one time secretary of state for foreign affairs he had always bulked
largely in the counsels of the empire and his country seat chimneys was famous for its hospitality ably seconded by his wife a daughter
of the duke of perth history had been made and unmade at informal
week-end parties at chimneys and there was hardly anyone of note in
england—or indeed in europe—who had not at one time or another stayed there that was all very well the ninth marquis of caterham had the utmost
respect and esteem for the memory of his brother henry had done that
kind of thing magnificently what lord caterham objected to was the
assumption that he was bound to follow in his brother’s footsteps and that chimneys was a national possession rather than a private
country house there was nothing that bored lord caterham more than
politics—unless it was politicians hence his impatience under the
continued eloquence of george lomax a robust man george lomax inclined to _embonpoint_ with a red face and protuberant eyes and an
immense sense of his own importance “you see the point caterham we can’t—we simply can’t afford a
scandal of any kind just now the position is one of the utmost
delicacy ”
“it always is ” said lord caterham with a flavour of irony “my dear fellow i’m in a position to _know_ ”
“oh quite so quite so ” said lord caterham falling back upon his
previous line of defence “one slip over this herzoslovakian business and we’re done it is most
important that the oil concessions should be granted to a british
company you must see that ”
“of course of course ”
“prince michael obolovitch arrives the end of the week and the whole
thing can be carried through at chimneys under the guise of a shooting
party ”
“i was thinking of going abroad this week ” said lord caterham “nonsense my dear caterham no one goes abroad in early october ”
“my doctor seems to think i’m in rather a bad way ” said lord caterham eyeing a taxi that was crawling past with longing eyes he was quite unable to make a dash for liberty however since lomax
had the unpleasant habit of retaining a hold upon a person with whom
he was engaged in serious conversation—doubtless the result of long
experience in this case he had a firm grip of the lapel of lord
caterham’s coat “my dear man i put it to you imperially in a moment of national
crisis such as is fast approaching——”
lord caterham wriggled uneasily he felt suddenly that he would rather
give any number of house parties than listen to george lomax quoting
from one of his own speeches he knew by experience that lomax was
quite capable of going on for twenty minutes without a stop “all right ” he said hastily “i’ll do it you’ll arrange the whole
thing i suppose ”
“my dear fellow there’s nothing to arrange chimneys quite apart
from its historic associations is ideally situated i shall be at the
abbey less than seven miles away it wouldn’t do of course for me to
be actually a member of the house party ”
“of course not ” agreed lord caterham who had no idea why it would not
do and was not interested to learn “perhaps you wouldn’t mind having bill eversleigh though he’d be
useful to run messages ”
“delighted ” said lord caterham with a shade more animation “bill’s
quite a decent shot and bundle likes him ”
“the shooting of course is not really important it’s only the
pretext as it were ”
lord caterham looked depressed again “that will be all then the prince his suite bill eversleigh herman
isaacstein——”
“who ”
“herman isaacstein the representative of the syndicate i spoke to you
about ”
“the all british syndicate ”
“yes why ”
“nothing—nothing—i only wondered that’s all curious names these
people have ”
“then of course there ought to be one or two outsiders—just to
give the thing a _bona fide_ appearance lady eileen could see to
that—young people uncritical and with no idea of politics ”
“bundle would attend to that all right i’m sure ”
“i wonder now ” lomax seemed struck by an idea “you remember the matter i was speaking about just now ”
“you’ve been speaking about so many things ”
“no no i mean this unfortunate _contretemps_”—— he lowered his
voice to a mysterious whisper—“the memoirs—count stylptitch’s
memoirs ”
“i think you’re wrong about that ” said lord caterham suppressing
a yawn “people _like_ scandal damn it all i read reminiscences
myself—and enjoy ’em too ”
“the point is not whether people will read them or not—they’ll read
them fast enough—but their publication at this juncture might ruin
everything—everything the people of herzoslovakia wish to restore the
monarchy and are prepared to offer the crown to prince michael who has
the support and encouragement of his majesty’s government——”
“and who is prepared to grant concessions to mr ikey hermanstein & co in return for the loan of a million or so to set him on the throne——”
“caterham caterham ” implored lomax in an agonized whisper “discretion i beg of you above all things discretion ”
“and the point is ” continued lord caterham with some relish though
he lowered his voice in obedience to the other’s appeal “that some
of stylptitch’s reminiscences may upset the apple cart tyranny and
misbehaviour of the obolovitch family generally eh questions asked in
the house why replace the present broad-minded and democratic form of
government by an obsolete tyranny policy dictated by the blood-sucking
capitalists down with the government that kind of thing—eh ”
lomax nodded “and there might be worse still ” he breathed “suppose—only
suppose that some reference should be made to—to that unfortunate
disappearance—you know what i mean ”
lord caterham stared at him “no i don’t what disappearance ”
“you must have heard of it why it happened while they were at
chimneys henry was terribly upset about it it almost ruined his
career ”
“you interest me enormously ” said lord caterham “who or what
disappeared ”
lomax leant forward and put his mouth to lord caterham’s ear the
latter withdrew it hastily “for god’s sake don’t hiss at me ”
“you heard what i said ”
“yes i did ” said lord caterham reluctantly “i remember now hearing
something about it at the time very curious affair i wonder who did
it it was never recovered ”
“never of course we had to go about the matter with the utmost
discretion no hint of the loss could be allowed to leak out but
stylptitch was there at the time he knew something not all but
something we were at loggerheads with him once or twice over the
turkish question suppose that in sheer malice he has set the whole
thing down for the world to read think of the scandal—of the
far-reaching results every one would say—why was it hushed up ”
“of course they would ” said lord caterham with evident enjoyment lomax whose voice had risen to a high pitch took a grip on himself “i must keep calm ” he murmured “i must keep calm but i ask you
this my dear fellow if he didn’t mean mischief why did he send the
manuscript to london in this roundabout way ”
“it’s odd certainly you are sure of your facts ”
“absolutely we—er—had our agents in paris the memoirs were conveyed
away secretly some weeks before his death ”
“yes it looks as though there’s something in it ” said lord caterham with the same relish he had displayed before “we have found out that they were sent to a man called jimmy or james mcgrath a canadian at present in africa ”
“quite an imperial affair isn’t it ” said lord caterham cheerily “james mcgrath is due to arrive by the _granarth castle_
to-morrow—thursday ”
“what are you going to do about it ”
“we shall of course approach him at once point out the possibly
serious consequences and beg him to defer publication of the
memoirs for at least a month and in any case to permit them to be
judiciously—er—edited ”
“supposing that he says ‘no sir ’ or ‘i’ll goddarned well see you in
hell first ’ or something bright and breezy like that ” suggested lord
caterham “that’s just what i’m afraid of ” said lomax simply “that’s why it
suddenly occurred to me that it might be a good thing to ask him down
to chimneys as well he’d be flattered naturally at being asked to
meet prince michael and it might be easier to handle him ”
“i’m not going to do it ” said lord caterham hastily “i don’t get on
with canadians never did—especially those that have lived much in
africa ”
“you’d probably find him a splendid fellow—a rough diamond you know ”
“no lomax i put my foot down there absolutely somebody else has got
to tackle him ”
“it has occurred to me ” said lomax “that a woman might be very useful
here told enough and not too much you understand a woman could
handle the whole thing delicately and with tact—put the position
before him as it were without getting his back up not that i approve
of women in politics—st stephen’s is ruined absolutely ruined nowadays but woman in her own sphere can do wonders look at henry’s
wife and what she did for him marcia was magnificent unique a
perfect political hostess ”
“you don’t want me to ask marcia down for this party do you ” asked
lord caterham faintly turning a little pale at the mention of his
redoubtable sister-in-law “no no you misunderstand me i was speaking of the influence of women
in general no i suggest a young woman a woman of charm beauty intelligence ”
“not bundle bundle would be no use at all she’s a red-hot socialist
if she’s anything at all and she’d simply scream with laughter at the
suggestion ”
“i was not thinking of lady eileen your daughter caterham is
charming simply charming but quite a child we need some one with
_savoir faire_ poise knowledge of the world—— ah of course the
very person my cousin virginia ”
“mrs revel ” lord caterham brightened up he began to feel that he
might possibly enjoy the party after all “a very good suggestion of
yours lomax the most charming woman in london ”
“she is well up in herzoslovakian affairs too her husband was at the
embassy there you remember and as you say a woman of great personal
charm ”
“a delightful creature ” murmured lord caterham “that is settled then ”
mr lomax relaxed his hold on lord caterham’s lapel and the latter was
quick to avail himself of the chance “bye-bye lomax you’ll make all the arrangements won’t you ”
he dived into a taxi as far as it is possible for one upright
christian gentleman to dislike another upright christian gentleman lord caterham disliked the hon george lomax he disliked his puffy red
face his heavy breathing and his prominent blue eyes he thought of
the coming week and sighed a nuisance an abominable nuisance then he
thought of virginia revel and cheered up a little “a delightful creature ” he murmured to himself “a most delightful
creature ”"
Chapter 4,"4
introducing a very charming lady
george lomax returned straightway to whitehall as he entered the
sumptuous apartment in which he transacted affairs of state there was
a scuffling sound mr bill eversleigh was assiduously filing letters but a large
arm-chair near the window was still warm from contact with a human form a very likeable young man bill eversleigh age at a guess twenty-five big and rather ungainly in his movements a pleasurably
ugly face a splendid set of white teeth and a pair of honest brown
eyes “richardson sent up that report yet ”
“no sir shall i get on to him about it ”
“it doesn’t matter any telephone messages ”
“miss oscar is dealing with most of them mr isaacstein wants to know
if you can dine with him at the savoy to-morrow ”
“tell miss oscar to look in my engagement-book if i’m not engaged she
can ring up and accept ”
“yes sir ”
“by the way eversleigh you might ring up a number for me now look it
up in the book mrs revel 487 pont street ”
“yes sir ”
bill seized the telephone-book ran an unseeing eye down a column of
m’s shut the book with a bang and moved to the instrument on the desk with his hand upon it he paused as though in sudden recollection “oh i say sir i’ve just remembered her line’s out of order mrs revel’s i mean i was trying to ring her up just now ”
george lomax frowned “annoying ” he said “distinctly annoying ” he tapped the table
undecidedly “if it’s anything important sir perhaps i might go round there now in
a taxi she’s sure to be in at this time in the morning ”
george lomax hesitated pondering the matter bill waited expectantly poised for instant flight should the reply be favourable “perhaps that would be the best plan ” said lomax at last “very well then take a taxi there and ask mrs revel if she will be at home this
afternoon at four o’clock as i am very anxious to see her about an
important matter ”
“right sir ”
bill seized his hat and departed ten minutes later a taxi deposited him at 487 pont street he rang
the bell and executed a loud rat-tat on the knocker the door was
opened by a grave functionary to whom bill nodded with the ease of long
acquaintance “morning chilvers mrs revel in ”
“i believe sir that she is just going out ”
“is that you bill ” called a voice over the banisters “i thought i
recognized that muscular knock come up and talk to me ”
bill looked up at the face that was laughing down on him and which
was always inclined to reduce him—and not him alone—to a state of
babbling incoherency he took the stairs two at a time and clasped
virginia revel’s out-stretched hands tightly in his “hullo virginia ”
“hullo bill ”
charm is a very peculiar thing; hundreds of young women some of them
more beautiful than virginia revel might have said “hullo bill ”
with exactly the same intonation and yet have produced no effect
whatever but those two simple words uttered by virginia had the
most intoxicating effect upon bill virginia revel was just twenty-seven she was tall and of an exquisite
slimness—indeed a poem might have been written to her slimness it
was so exquisitely proportioned her hair was of real bronze with the
greenish tint in its gold; she had a determined little chin a lovely
nose slanting blue eyes that showed a gleam of deepest cornflower
between the half-closed lids and a delicious and quite indescribable
mouth that tilted ever so slightly at one corner in what is known as
“the signature of venus ” it was a wonderfully expressive face and
there was a sort of radiant vitality about her that always challenged
attention it would have been quite impossible ever to ignore virginia
revel she drew bill into the small drawing-room which was all pale and mauve
and green and yellow like crocuses surprised in a meadow “bill darling ” said virginia “isn’t the foreign office missing you i thought they couldn’t get on without you ”
“i’ve brought a message for you from codders ”
thus irreverently did bill allude to his chief “and by the way virginia in case he asks remember that your
telephone was out of order this morning ”
“but it hasn’t been ”
“i know that but i said it was ”
“why enlighten me as to this foreign office touch ”
bill threw her a reproachful glance “so that i could get here and see you of course ”
“oh darling bill how dense of me and how perfectly sweet of you ”
“chilvers said you were going out ”
“so i was—to sloane street there’s a place there where they’ve got a
perfectly wonderful new hip band ”
“a hip band ”
“yes bill h i p hip b a n d band a band to confine the hips you
wear it next the skin ”
“i blush for you virginia you shouldn’t describe your underwear to a
young man to whom you are not related it isn’t delicate ”
“but bill dear there’s nothing indelicate about hips we’ve all got
hips—although we poor women are trying awfully hard to pretend we
haven’t this hip band is made of red rubber and comes just to above
the knee and it’s simply impossible to walk in it ”
“how awful ” said bill “why do you do it ”
“oh because it gives one such a noble feeling to suffer for one’s
silhouette but don’t let’s talk about my hip band give me george’s
message ”
“he wants to know whether you’ll be in at four o’clock this afternoon ”
“i shan’t i shall be at ranelagh why this sort of formal call is he
going to propose to me do you think ”
“i shouldn’t wonder ”
“because if so you can tell him that i much prefer men who propose on
impulse ”
“like me ”
“it’s not an impulse with you bill it’s habit ”
“virginia won’t you ever——”
“no no no bill i won’t have it in the morning before lunch do try
and think of me as a nice motherly person approaching middle age who
has your interests thoroughly at heart ”
“virginia i do love you so ”
“i know bill i know and i simply love being loved isn’t it wicked
and dreadful of me i should like every nice man in the world to be in
love with me ”
“most of them are i expect ” said bill gloomily “but i hope george isn’t in love with me i don’t think he can be he’s
so wedded to his career what else did he say ”
“just that it was very important ”
“bill i’m getting intrigued the things that george thinks important
are so awfully limited i think i must chuck ranelagh after all i
can go to ranelagh any day tell george that i shall be awaiting him
meekly at four o’clock ”
bill looked at his wrist watch “it seems hardly worth while to go back before lunch come out and chew
something virginia ”
“i’m going out to lunch somewhere or other ”
“that doesn’t matter make a day of it and chuck everything all round ”
“it would be rather nice ” said virginia smiling at him “virginia you’re a darling tell me you do like me rather don’t you better than other people ”
“bill i adore you if i had to marry some one—simply had to—i mean
if it was in a book and a wicked mandarin said to me ‘marry some one or
die by slow torture ’ i should choose you at once—i should indeed i
should say ‘give me little bill ’”
“well then——”
“yes but i haven’t got to marry any one i love being a wicked widow ”
“you could do all the same things still go about and all that you’d
hardly notice me about the house ”
“bill you don’t understand i’m the kind of person who marries
enthusiastically if they marry at all ”
bill gave a hollow groan “i shall shoot myself one of these days i expect ” he murmured
gloomily “no you won’t bill darling you’ll take a pretty girl out to
supper—like you did the night before last ”
mr eversleigh was momentarily confused “if you mean dorothy kirkpatrick the girl who’s in _hooks and eyes_ i—well dash it all she’s a thoroughly nice girl straight as they
make ’em there was no harm in it ”
“bill darling of course there wasn’t i love you to enjoy yourself but don’t pretend to be dying of a broken heart that’s all ”
mr eversleigh recovered his dignity “you don’t understand at all virginia ” he said severely “men——”
“are polygamous i know they are sometimes i have a shrewd suspicion
that i am polyandrous if you really love me bill take me out to
lunch quickly ”"
Chapter 5,"5
first night in london
there is often a flaw in the best-laid plans george lomax had made one
mistake—there was a weak spot in his preparations the weak spot was
bill bill eversleigh was an extremely nice lad he was a good cricketer and
a scratch golfer he had pleasant manners and an amiable disposition but his position in the foreign office had been gained not by brains but by good connections for the work he had to do he was quite
suitable he was more or less george’s dog he did no responsible
or brainy work his part was to be constantly at george’s elbow to
interview unimportant people whom george didn’t want to see to run
errands and generally to make himself useful all this bill carried
out faithfully enough when george was absent bill stretched himself
out in the biggest chair and read the sporting news and in so doing he
was merely carrying out a time-honoured tradition being accustomed to send bill on errands george had dispatched him to
the union castle offices to find out when the _granarth castle_ was due
in now in common with most well-educated young englishmen bill had
a pleasant but quite inaudible voice any elocution master would have
found fault with his pronunciation of the word granarth it might have
been anything the clerk took it to be carnfrae the _carnfrae castle_
was due in on the following thursday he said so bill thanked him and
went out george lomax accepted the information and laid his plans
accordingly he knew nothing about union castle liners and took it
for granted that james mcgrath would duly arrive on thursday therefore at the moment he was buttonholing lord caterham on the steps
of the club on wednesday morning he would have been greatly surprised
to learn that the _granarth castle_ had docked at southampton the
preceding afternoon at two o’clock that afternoon anthony cade travelling under the name
of jimmy mcgrath stepped out of the boat train at waterloo hailed a
taxi and after a moment’s hesitation ordered the driver to proceed to
the blitz hotel “one might as well be comfortable ” said anthony to himself as he
looked with some interest out of the taxi windows it was exactly fourteen years since he had been in london he arrived at the hotel booked a room and then went for a short
stroll along the embankment it was rather pleasant to be back in
london again everything was changed of course there had been a
little restaurant there—just past blackfriars bridge—where he had
dined fairly often in company with other earnest lads he had been a
socialist then and worn a flowing red tie young—very young he retraced his steps back to the blitz just as he was crossing the
road a man jostled against him nearly making him lose his balance they both recovered themselves and the man muttered an apology his
eyes scanning anthony’s face narrowly he was a short thickset man of
the working classes with something foreign in his appearance anthony went on into the hotel wondering as he did so what had
inspired that searching glance nothing in it probably the deep tan of
his face was somewhat unusual looking amongst these pallid londoners
and it had attracted the fellow’s attention he went up to his room
and led by a sudden impulse crossed to the looking-glass and stood
studying his face in it of the few friends of the old days—just a
chosen few—was it likely that any of them would recognize him now if
they were to meet him face to face he shook his head slowly when he had left london he had been just eighteen—a fair slightly
chubby boy with a misleading seraphic expression small chance that
the boy would be recognized in the lean brown-faced man with the
quizzical expression the telephone beside the bed rang and anthony crossed to the receiver “hullo ”
the voice of the desk clerk answered him “mr james mcgrath ”
“speaking ”
“a gentleman has called to see you ”
anthony was rather astonished “to see _me_ ”
“yes sir a foreign gentleman ”
“what’s his name ”
there was a slight pause and then the clerk said:
“i will send up a page boy with his card ”
anthony replaced the receiver and waited in a few minutes there was
a knock on the door and a small page appeared bearing a card upon a
salver anthony took it the following was the name engraved upon it:
 baron lolopretjzyl he now fully appreciated the desk clerk’s pause for a moment or two he stood studying the card and then made up his
mind “show the gentleman up ”
“very good sir ”
in a few minutes the baron _lolopretjzyl_ was ushered into the room a
big man with an immense fan-like black beard and a high bald forehead he brought his heels together with a click and bowed “mr mcgrath ” he said anthony imitated his movements as nearly as possible “baron ” he said then drawing forward a chair “pray sit down i have
not i think had the pleasure of meeting you before ”
“that is so ” agreed the baron seating himself “it is my misfortune ”
he added politely “and mine also ” responded anthony on the same note “let us now to business come ” said the baron “i represent in london
the loyalist party of herzoslovakia ”
“and represent it admirably i am sure ” murmured anthony the baron bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment “you are too kind ” he said stiffly “mr mcgrath i will not from
you conceal anything the moment has come for the restoration of the
monarchy in abeyance since the martyrdom of his most gracious majesty
king nicolas iv of blessed memory ”
“amen ” murmured anthony “i mean hear hear ”
“on the throne will be placed his highness prince michael who the
support of the british government has ”
“splendid ” said anthony “it’s very kind of you to tell me all this ”
“everything arranged is—when you come here to trouble make ”
the baron fixed him with a stern eye “my dear baron ” protested anthony “yes yes i know what i am talking about you have with you the
memoirs of the late count stylptitch ”
he fixed anthony with an accusing eye “and if i have what have the memoirs of count stylptitch to do with
prince michael ”
“they will cause scandals ”
“most memoirs do that ” said anthony soothingly “of many secrets he the knowledge had should he reveal but the
quarter of them europe into war plunged may be ”
“come come ” said anthony “it can’t be as bad as all that ”
“an unfavourable opinion of the obolovitch will abroad be spread so
democratic is the english spirit ”
“i can quite believe ” said anthony “that the obolovitch may have been
a trifle high-handed now and again it runs in the blood but people in
england expect that sort of thing from the balkans i don’t know why
they should but they do ”
“you do not understand ” said the baron “you do not understand at all and my lips sealed are ” he sighed “what exactly are you afraid of ” asked anthony “until i have read the memoirs i do not know ” explained the baron
simply “but there is sure to be something these great diplomats are
always indiscreet the apple cart upset will be as the saying goes ”
“look here ” said anthony kindly “i’m sure you’re taking altogether
too pessimistic a view of the thing i know all about publishers—they
sit on manuscripts and hatch ’em like eggs it will be at least a year
before the thing is published ”
“either a very deceitful or a very simple young man you are all is
arranged for the memoirs in a sunday newspaper to come out immediately ”
“oh ” anthony was somewhat taken aback “but you can always deny
everything ” he said hopefully the baron shook his head sadly “no no through the hat you talk let us to business come one
thousand pounds you are to have is it not so you see i have the good
information got ”
“i certainly congratulate the intelligence department of the loyalists ”
“then i to you offer fifteen hundred ”
anthony stared at him in amazement then shook his head ruefully “i’m afraid it can’t be done ” he said with regret “good i to you offer two thousand ”
“you tempt me baron you tempt me but i still say it can’t be done ”
“your own price name then ”
“i’m afraid you don’t understand the position i’m perfectly willing to
believe that you are on the side of the angels and that these memoirs
may damage your cause nevertheless i’ve undertaken the job and i’ve
got to carry it through see i can’t allow myself to be bought off by
the other side that kind of thing isn’t done ”
the baron listened very attentively at the end of anthony’s speech he
nodded his head several times “i see your honour as an english gentleman it is ”
“well we don’t put it that way ourselves ” said anthony “but i dare
say allowing for a difference in vocabulary that we both mean much
the same thing ”
the baron rose to his feet “for the english honour i much respect have ” he announced “we must
another way try i wish you good morning ”
he drew his heels together clicked bowed and marched out of the room holding himself stiffly erect “now i wonder what he meant by that ” mused anthony “was it a threat not that i’m in the least afraid of old lollipop rather a good name
for him that by the way i shall call him baron lollipop ”
he took a turn or two up and down the room undecided on his next
course of action the date stipulated upon for delivering the
manuscript was a little over a week ahead to-day was the 5th of
october anthony had no intention of handing it over before the last
moment truth to tell he was by now feverishly anxious to read
these memoirs he had meant to do so on the boat coming over but
had been laid low with a touch of fever and not at all in the mood
for deciphering crabbed and illegible handwriting for none of the
manuscript was typed he was now more than ever determined to see what
all the fuss was about there was the other job too on an impulse he picked up the telephone book and looked up the name
of revel there were six revels in the book: edward henry revel surgeon of harley street; james revel & co saddlers; lennox revel
of abbotbury mansions hampstead; miss mary revel with an address in
ealing; hon mrs timothy revel of 487 pont street; and mrs willis
revel of 42 cadogan square eliminating the saddlers and miss mary
revel that gave him four names to investigate—and there was no reason
to suppose that the lady lived in london at all he shut up the book
with a short shake of the head “for the moment i’ll leave it to chance ” he said “something usually
turns up ”
the luck of the anthony cades of this world is perhaps in some measure
due to their own belief in it anthony found what he was after not half
an hour later when he was turning over the pages of an illustrated
paper it was a representation of some tableau organized by the duchess
of perth below the central figure a woman in eastern dress was the
inscription:
“the hon mrs timothy revel as cleopatra before her marriage mrs revel was the hon virginia cawthron a daughter of lord edgbaston ”
anthony looked at the picture some time slowly pursing up his lips as
though to whistle then he tore out the whole page folded it up and
put it in his pocket he went upstairs again unlocked his suit-case
and took out the packet of letters he took out the folded page from
his pocket and slipped it under the string that held them together then at a sudden sound behind him he wheeled round sharply a
man was standing in the doorway the kind of man whom anthony had
fondly imagined existed only in the chorus of a comic opera a
sinister-looking figure with a squat brutal head and lips drawn back
in an evil grin “what the devil are you doing here ” asked anthony “and who let you
come up ”
“i pass where i please ” said the stranger his voice was guttural and
foreign though his english was idiomatic enough “another dago ” thought anthony “well get out do you hear ” he went on aloud the man’s eyes were fixed on the packet of letters which anthony had
caught up “i will get out when you have given me what i have come for ”
“and what’s that may i ask ”
the man took a step nearer “the memoirs of count stylptitch ” he hissed “it’s impossible to take you seriously ” said anthony “you’re so
completely the stage villain i like your get up very much who sent
you here baron lollipop ”
“baron—— ” the man jerked out a string of harsh-sounding consonants “so that’s how you pronounce it is it a cross between gargling and
barking like a dog i don’t think i could say it myself—my throat’s
not made that way i shall have to go on calling him lollipop so he
sent you did he ”
but he received a vehement negative his visitor went so far as to spit
upon the suggestion in a very realistic manner then he drew from his
pocket a sheet of paper which he threw upon the table “look ” he said “look and tremble accursed englishman ”
anthony looked with some interest not troubling to fulfil the latter
part of the command on the paper was traced the crude design of a
human hand in red “it looks like a hand ” he remarked “but if you say so i’m quite
prepared to admit that it’s a cubist picture of sunset at the north
pole ”
“it is the sign of the comrades of the red hand i am a comrade of the
red hand ”
“you don’t say so ” said anthony looking at him with much interest “are the others all like you i don’t know what the eugenic society
would have to say about it ”
the man snarled angrily “dog ” he said “worse than dog paid slave of an effete monarchy give
me the memoirs and you shall go unscathed such is the clemency of the
brotherhood ”
“it’s very kind of them i’m sure ” said anthony “but i’m afraid
that both they and you are labouring under a misapprehension my
instructions are to deliver the manuscript—not to your amiable
society but to a certain firm of publishers ”
“pah ” laughed the other “do you think you will ever be permitted to
reach that office alive enough of this fool’s talk hand over the
papers or i shoot ”
he drew a revolver from his pocket and brandished it in the air but there he misjudged his anthony cade he was not used to men who
could act as quickly—or quicker than they could think anthony did not
wait to be covered by the revolver almost as soon as the other got it
out of his pocket anthony had sprung forward and knocked it out of his
hand the force of the blow sent the man swinging round so that he
presented his back to his assailant the chance was too good to be missed with one mighty well-directed
kick anthony sent the man flying through the doorway into the
corridor where he collapsed in a heap anthony stepped out after him but the doughty comrade of the red hand
had had enough he got nimbly to his feet and fled down the passage anthony did not pursue him but went back into his own room “so much for the comrades of the red hand ” he remarked “picturesque
appearance but easily routed by direct action how the hell did that
fellow get in i wonder there’s one thing that stands out pretty
clearly—this isn’t going to be quite such a soft job as i thought i’ve already fallen foul of both the loyalist and the revolutionary
parties soon i suppose the nationalists and the independent liberals
will be sending up a delegation one thing’s fixed i start on that
manuscript to-night ”
looking at his watch anthony discovered that it was nearly nine
o’clock and he decided to dine where he was he did not anticipate
any more surprise visits but he felt that it was up to him to be on
his guard he had no intention of allowing his suit-case to be rifled
whilst he was downstairs in the grill room he rang the bell and asked
for the menu selected a couple of dishes and ordered a bottle of
bordeaux the waiter took the order and withdrew whilst he was waiting for the meal to arrive he got out the package of
manuscript and put it on the table with the letters there was a knock at the door and the waiter entered with a small
table and the accessories of the meal anthony had strolled over to the
mantelpiece standing there with his back to the room he was directly
facing the mirror and idly glancing in it he noticed a curious thing the waiter’s eyes were glued on the parcel of manuscript shooting
little glances sideways at anthony’s immovable back he moved softly
round the table his hands were twitching and he kept passing his
tongue over his dry lips anthony observed him more closely he was a
tall man supple like all waiters with a clean-shaven mobile face an
italian anthony thought not a frenchman at the critical moment anthony wheeled round abruptly the waiter
started slightly but pretended to be doing something with the salt
cellar “what’s your name ” asked anthony abruptly “giuseppe monsieur ”
“italian eh ”
“yes monsieur ”
anthony spoke to him in that language and the man answered fluently
enough finally anthony dismissed him with a nod but all the while
he was eating the excellent meal which giuseppe served to him he was
thinking rapidly had he been mistaken was giuseppe’s interest in the parcel just
ordinary curiosity it might be so but remembering the feverish
intensity of the man’s excitement anthony decided against that theory all the same he was puzzled “dash it all ” said anthony to himself “every one can’t be after the
blasted manuscript perhaps i’m fancying things ”
dinner concluded and cleared away he applied himself to the perusal of
the memoirs owing to the illegibility of the late count’s handwriting the business was a slow one anthony’s yawns succeeded one another with
suspicious rapidity at the end of the fourth chapter he gave it up so far he had found the memoirs insufferably dull with no hint of
scandal of any kind he gathered up the letters and the wrapping of the manuscript which
were lying in a heap together on the table and locked them up in the
suit-case then he locked the door and as an additional precaution put
a chair against it on the chair he placed the water-bottle from the
bathroom surveying these preparations with some pride he undressed and got into
bed he had one more shot at the count’s memoirs but felt his eyelids
drooping and stuffing the manuscript under his pillow he switched out
the light and fell asleep almost immediately it must have been some four hours later that he awoke with a start what had awakened him he did not know—perhaps a sound perhaps only
the consciousness of danger which in men who have led an adventurous
life is very fully developed for a moment he lay quite still trying to focus his impressions he
could hear a very stealthy rustle and then he became aware of a denser
blackness somewhere between him and the window—on the floor by the
suit-case with a sudden spring anthony jumped out of bed switching the light on
as he did so a figure sprang up from where it had been kneeling by the
suit-case it was the waiter giuseppe in his right hand gleamed a long thin
knife he hurled himself straight upon anthony who was by now fully
conscious of his own danger he was unarmed and giuseppe was evidently
thoroughly at home with his own weapon anthony sprang to one side and giuseppe missed him with the knife the next minute the two men were rolling on the floor together locked
in a close embrace the whole of anthony’s faculties were centred on
keeping a close grip of giuseppe’s right arm so that he would be unable
to use the knife he bent it slowly back at the same time he felt the
italian’s other hand clutching at his windpipe stifling him choking and still desperately he bent the right arm back there was a sharp tinkle as the knife fell on the floor at the same
time the italian extricated himself with a swift twist from anthony’s
grasp anthony sprang up too but made the mistake of moving towards
the door to cut off the other’s retreat he saw too late that the
chair and the water-bottle were just as he had arranged them giuseppe had entered by the window and it was the window he made for
now in the instant’s respite given him by anthony’s move toward the
door he had sprung out on the balcony leaped over to the adjoining
balcony and had disappeared through the adjoining window anthony knew well enough that it was of no use to pursue him his
way of retreat was doubtless fully assured anthony would merely get
himself into trouble he walked over to the bed thrusting his hand beneath the pillow and
drawing out the memoirs lucky that they had been there and not in the
suit-case he crossed over to the suit-case and looked inside meaning
to take out the letters then he swore softly under his breath _the letters were gone _"
Chapter 6,"6
the gentle art of blackmail
it was exactly five minutes to four when virginia revel rendered
punctual by a healthy curiosity returned to the house in pont street she opened the door with her latchkey and stepped into the hall to be
immediately confronted by the impassive chilvers “i beg pardon ma’am but a—a person has called to see you——”
for the moment virginia did not pay attention to the subtle
phraseology whereby chilvers cloaked his meaning “mr lomax where is he in the drawing-room ”
“oh no ma’am not mr lomax ” chilvers’ tone was faintly reproachful “a person—i was reluctant to let him in but he said his business
was most important—connected with the late captain i understood
him to say thinking therefore that you might wish to see him i put
him—er—in the study ”
virginia stood thinking for a minute she had been a widow now for some
years and the fact that she rarely spoke of her husband was taken by
some to indicate that below her careless demeanour was a still aching
wound by others it was taken to mean the exact opposite that virginia
had never really cared for tim revel and that she found it insincere
to profess a grief she did not feel “i should have mentioned ma’am ” continued chilvers “that the man
appears to be some kind of foreigner ”
virginia’s interest heightened a little her husband had been in the
diplomatic service and they had been together in herzoslovakia just
before the sensational murder of the king and queen this man might
probably be a herzoslovakian some old servant who had fallen on evil
days “you did quite right chilvers ” she said with a quick approving nod “where did you say you had put him in the study ”
she crossed the hall with her light buoyant step and opened the door
of the small room that flanked the dining-room the visitor was sitting in a chair by the fireplace he rose on her
entrance and stood looking at her virginia had an excellent memory for
faces and she was at once quite sure that she had never seen the man
before he was tall and dark supple in figure and quite unmistakably
a foreigner; but she did not think he was of slavonic origin she put
him down as italian or possibly spanish “you wished to see me ” she asked “i am mrs revel ”
the man did not answer for a minute or two he was looking her slowly
over as though appraising her narrowly there was a veiled insolence
in his manner which she was quick to feel “will you please state your business ” she said with a touch of
impatience “you are mrs revel mrs timothy revel ”
“yes i told you so just now ”
“quite so it is a good thing that you consented to see me mrs revel otherwise as i told your butler i should have been compelled to do
business with your husband ”
virginia looked at him in astonishment but some impulse quelled the
retort that sprang to her lips she contented herself by remarking
dryly:
“you might have found some difficulty in doing that ”
“i think not i am very persistent but i will come to the point perhaps you recognize this ”
he flourished something in his hand virginia looked at it without much
interest “can you tell me what it is madame ”
“it appears to be a letter ” replied virginia who was by now convinced
that she had to do with a man who was mentally unhinged “and perhaps you note to whom it is addressed ” said the man
significantly holding it out to her “i can read ” virginia informed him pleasantly “it is addressed to a
captain o’neill at rue de quenelles no 15 paris ”
the man seemed searching her face hungrily for something he did not
find “will you read it please ”
virginia took the envelope from him drew out the enclosure and glanced
at it; but almost immediately she stiffened and held it out to him
again “this is a private letter—certainly not meant for my eyes ”
the man laughed sardonically “i congratulate you mrs revel on your admirable acting you play
your part to perfection nevertheless i think that you will hardly be
able to deny the signature ”
“the signature ”
virginia turned the letter over—and was struck dumb with astonishment the signature written in a delicate slanting hand was virginia revel checking the exclamation of astonishment that rose to her lips she
turned again to the beginning of the letter and deliberately read the
whole thing through then she stood a minute lost in thought the
nature of the letter made it clear enough what was in prospect “well madame ” said the man “that is your name is it not ”
“oh yes ” said virginia “it’s my name ” “but not my handwriting ” she
might have added instead she turned a dazzling smile upon her visitor “supposing ” she said sweetly “we sit down and talk it over ”
he was puzzled not so had he expected her to behave his instinct
told him that she was not afraid of him “first of all i should like to know how you found me out ”
“that was easy ”
he took from his pocket a page torn from an illustrated paper and
handed it to her anthony cade would have recognized it she gave it back to him with a thoughtful little frown “i see ” she said “it was very easy ”
“of course you understand mrs revel that that is not the only
letter there are others ”
“dear me ” said virginia “i seem to have been frightfully indiscreet ”
again she could see that her light tone puzzled him she was by now
thoroughly enjoying herself “at any rate ” she said smiling sweetly at him “it’s very kind of you
to call and give them back to me ”
there was a pause as he cleared his throat “i am a poor man mrs revel ” he said at last with a good deal of
significance in his manner “as such you will doubtless find it easier to enter the kingdom of
heaven or so i have always heard ”
“i cannot afford to let you have these letters for nothing ”
“i think you are under a misapprehension those letters are the
property of the person who wrote them ”
“that may be the law madame but in this country you have a saying
‘possession is nine points of the law ’ and in any case are you
prepared to invoke the aid of the law ”
“the law is a severe one for blackmailers ” virginia reminded him “come mrs revel i am not quite a fool i have read these
letters—the letters of a woman to her lover one and all breathing
dread of discovery by her husband do you want me to take them to your
husband ”
“you have overlooked one possibility those letters were written some
years ago supposing that since then—i have become a widow ”
he shook his head with confidence “in that case—if you had nothing to fear—you would not be sitting
here making terms with me ”
virginia smiled “what is your price ” she asked in a business-like manner “for one thousand pounds i will hand the whole packet over to you it
is very little that i am asking there; but you see i do not like the
business ”
“i shouldn’t dream of paying you a thousand pounds ” said virginia with
decision “madame i never bargain a thousand pounds and i will place the
letters in your hands ”
virginia reflected “you must give me a little time to think it over it will not be easy
for me to get such a sum together ”
“a few pounds on account perhaps—say fifty—and i will call again ”
virginia looked up at the clock it was five minutes past four and she
fancied that she had heard the bell “very well ” she said hurriedly “come back to-morrow but later than
this about six ”
she crossed over to a desk that stood against the wall unlocked one of
the drawers and took out an untidy handful of notes “there is about forty pounds here that will have to do for you ”
he snatched at it eagerly “and now go at once please ” said virginia he left the room obediently enough through the open door virginia
caught a glimpse of george lomax in the hall just being ushered
upstairs by chilvers as the front door closed virginia called to him “come in here george chilvers bring us tea in here will you please ”
she flung open both windows and george lomax came into the room to
find her standing erect with dancing eyes and wind-blown hair “i’ll shut them in a minute george but i felt the room ought to be
aired did you fall over the blackmailer in the hall ”
“the what ”
“blackmailer george b l a c k m a i l e r blackmailer one who
blackmails ”
“my dear virginia you can’t be serious ”
“oh but i am george ”
“but who did he come here to blackmail ”
“me george ”
“but my dear virginia what have you been doing ”
“well just for once as it happens i hadn’t been doing anything the
good gentleman mistook me for someone else ”
“you rang up the police i suppose ”
“no i didn’t i suppose you think i ought to have done so ”
“well——” george considered weightily “no no perhaps not—perhaps
you acted wisely you might be mixed up in some unpleasant publicity in
connection with the case you might even have had to give evidence——”
“i should have liked that ” said virginia “i would love to be
summoned and i should like to see if judges really do make all the
rotten jokes you read about it would be most exciting i was at vine
street the other day to see about a diamond brooch i had lost and
there was the most perfectly lovely inspector—the nicest man i ever
met ”
george as was his custom let all irrelevancies pass “but what did you do about this scoundrel ”
“well george i’m afraid i let him do it ”
“do what ”
“blackmail me ”
george’s face of horror was so poignant that virginia had to bite her
under lip “you mean—do i understand you to mean—that you did not correct the
misapprehension under which he was labouring ”
virginia shook her head shooting a sideways glance at him “good heavens virginia you must be mad ”
“i suppose it would seem that way to you ”
“but why in god’s name why ”
“several reasons to begin with he was doing it so
beautifully—blackmailing me i mean—i hate to interrupt an artist
when he’s doing his job really well and then you see i’d never been
blackmailed——”
“i should hope not indeed ”
“and i wanted to see what it felt like ”
“i am quite at a loss to comprehend you virginia ”
“i knew you wouldn’t understand ”
“you did not give him money i hope ”
“just a trifle ” said virginia apologetically “how much ”
“forty pounds ”
“virginia ”
“my dear george it’s only what i pay for an evening dress it’s just
as exciting to buy a new experience as it is to buy a new dress—more
so in fact ”
george lomax merely shook his head and chilvers appearing at that
moment with the tea urn he was saved from having to express his
outraged feelings when tea had been brought in and virginia’s deft
fingers were manipulating the heavy silver teapot she spoke again on
the subject “i had another motive too george—a brighter and better one we women
are usually supposed to be cats but at any rate i’d done another woman
a good turn this afternoon this man isn’t likely to go off looking
for another virginia revel he thinks he’s found his bird all right poor little devil she was in a blue funk when she wrote that letter mr blackmailer would have had the easiest job of his life there now though he doesn’t know it he’s up against a tough proposition starting with the great advantage of having led a blameless life i
shall toy with him to his undoing—as they say in books guile george lots of guile ”
george still shook his head “i don’t like it ” he persisted “i don’t like it ”
“well never mind george dear you didn’t come here to talk about
blackmailers what did you come here for by the way correct answer:
‘to see _you_ ’ accent on the you and press her hand with significance
unless you happen to have been eating heavily buttered muffin in which
case it must all be done with the eyes ”
“i did come to see you ” replied george seriously “and i am glad to
find you alone ”
“oh george this is so sudden ” says she swallowing a currant “i wanted to ask a favour of you i have always considered you virginia as a woman of considerable charm ”
“oh george ”
“and also a woman of intelligence ”
“not really how well the man knows me ”
“my dear virginia there is a young fellow arriving in england
to-morrow whom i should like you to meet ”
“all right george but it’s your party—let that be clearly
understood ”
“you could i feel sure if you chose exercise your considerable
charm ”
virginia cocked her head a little on one side “george dear i don’t ‘charm’ as a profession you know often i like
people—and then well they like me but i don’t think i could set
out in cold blood to fascinate a helpless stranger that sort of thing
isn’t done george it really isn’t there are professional sirens who
would do it much better than i should ”
“that is out of the question virginia this young man he is a
canadian by the way of the name of mcgrath——”
“a canadian of scotch descent ” says she deducing brilliantly “is probably quite unused to the higher walks of english society i
should like him to appreciate the charm and distinction of a real
english gentlewoman ”
“meaning me ”
“exactly ”
“why ”
“i beg your pardon ”
“i said why you don’t boom the real english gentlewoman with every
stray canadian who sets foot upon our shores what is the deep idea george to put it vulgarly what do _you_ get out of it ”
“i cannot see that that concerns you virginia ”
“i couldn’t possibly go out for an evening and fascinate unless i knew
all the whys and wherefors ”
“you have a most extraordinary way of putting things virginia anyone
would think——”
“wouldn’t they come on george part with a little more information ”
“my dear virginia matters are likely to be a little strained shortly
in a certain central european nation it is important for reasons
which are immaterial that this—mr —er mcgrath should be brought
to realize that the restoring of the monarchy in herzoslovakia is
imperative to the peace of europe ”
“the part about the peace of europe is all bosh ” said virginia calmly “but i’m all for monarchies every time especially for a picturesque
people like the herzoslovakians so you’re running a king in the
herzoslovakian states are you who is he ”
george was reluctant to answer but did not see his way to avoid the
question the interview was not going at all as he had planned he
had foreseen virginia as a willing docile tool receiving his hints
gratefully and asking no awkward questions this was far from being
the case she seemed determined to know all about it and this george ever doubtful of female discretion was determined at all costs to
avoid he had made a mistake virginia was not the woman for the
part she might indeed cause serious trouble her account of her
interview with the blackmailer had caused him grave apprehension a
most undependable creature with no idea of treating serious matters
seriously “prince michael obolovitch ” he replied as virginia was obviously
waiting for an answer to her question “but please let that go no
further ”
“don’t be absurd george there are all sort of hints in the papers
already and articles cracking up the obolovitch dynasty and talking
about the murdered nicholas iv as though he were a cross between
a saint and a hero instead of a stupid little man besotted by a
third-rate actress ”
george winced he was more than ever convinced that he had made a
mistake in enlisting virginia’s aid he must stave her off quickly “you are right my dear virginia ” he said hastily as he rose to his
feet to bid her farewell “i should not have made the suggestion i did
to you but we are anxious for the dominions to see eye to eye with us
on this herzoslovakian crisis and mcgrath has i believe influence in
journalistic circles as an ardent monarchist and with your knowledge
of the country i thought it a good plan for you to meet him ”
“so that’s the explanation is it ”
“yes but i dare say you wouldn’t have cared for him ”
virginia looked at him for a second and then she laughed “george ” she said “you’re a rotten liar ”
“virginia ”
“rotten absolutely rotten if i had had your training i could
have managed a better one than that—one that had a chance of being
believed but i shall find out all about it my poor george rest
assured of that the mystery of mr mcgrath i shouldn’t wonder if i
got a hint or two at chimneys this week-end ”
“at chimneys you are going to chimneys ”
george could not conceal his perturbation he had hoped to reach lord
caterham in time for the invitation to remain unissued “bundle rang up and asked me this morning ”
george made a last effort “rather a dull party i believe ” he said “hardly in your line virginia ”
“my poor george why didn’t you tell me the truth and trust me it’s
still not too late ”
george took her hand and dropped it again limply “i have told you the truth ” he said coldly and he said it without a
blush “that’s a better one ” said virginia approvingly “but it’s still
not good enough cheer up george i shall be at chimneys all right exerting my considerable charm—as you put it life has become suddenly
very much more amusing first a blackmailer and then george in
diplomatic difficulties will he tell all to the beautiful woman who
asks for his confidence so pathetically no he will reveal nothing
until the last chapter good-bye george one last fond look before you
go no oh george dear don’t be sulky about it ”
virginia ran to the telephone as soon as george had departed with a
heavy gait through the front door she obtained the number she required and asked to speak to lady eileen
brent “is that you bundle i’m coming to chimneys all right to-morrow what bore me no it won’t bundle wild horses wouldn’t keep me away so
there ”"
Chapter 7,"7
mr mcgrath refuses an invitation
the letters were gone having once made up his mind to the fact of their disappearance there
was nothing to do but accept it anthony realized very well that he
could not pursue giuseppe through the corridors of the blitz hotel to
do so was to court undesired publicity and in all probability to fail
in his object all the same he came to the conclusion that giuseppe had mistaken the packet of
letters enclosed as they were in the other wrappings for the memoirs
themselves it was likely therefore that when he discovered his mistake
he would make another attempt to get hold of the memoirs for this
attempt anthony intended to be fully prepared another plan that occurred to him was to advertize discreetly for the
return of the package of letters supposing giuseppe to be an emissary
of the comrades of the red hand or which seemed to anthony more
probable to be employed by the loyalist party the letters could have
no possible interest for either employer and he would probably jump at
the chance of obtaining a small sum of money for their return having thought out all this anthony returned to bed and slept
peacefully until morning he did not fancy that giuseppe would be
anxious for a second encounter that night anthony got up with his plan of campaign fully thought out he had
a good breakfast glanced at the papers which were full of the new
discoveries of oil in herzoslovakia and then demanded an interview
with the manager and being anthony cade with a gift for getting his
own way by means of quiet determination he obtained what he asked for the manager a frenchman with an exquisitely suave manner received him
in his private office “you wished to see me i understand mr —er—mcgrath ”
“i did i arrived at your hotel yesterday afternoon and i had dinner
served to me in my own rooms by a waiter whose name was giuseppe ”
he paused “i dare say we have a waiter of that name ” agreed the manager
indifferently “i was struck by something unusual in the waiter’s manner but thought
nothing more of it at the time later in the night i was awakened by
the sound of some one moving softly about the room i switched on the
light and found this same giuseppe in the act of rifling my leather
suit-case ”
the manager’s indifference had completely disappeared now “but i have heard nothing of this ” he exclaimed “why was i not
informed sooner ”
“the man and i had a brief struggle—he was armed with a knife by the
way in the end he succeeded in making off by way of the window ”
“what did you do then mr mcgrath ”
“i examined the contents of my suit-case ”
“had anything been taken ”
“nothing of—importance ” said anthony slowly the manager leaned back with a sigh “i am glad of that ” he remarked “but you will allow me to say mr mcgrath that i do not quite understand your attitude in the matter you made no attempt to arouse the hotel to pursue the thief ”
anthony shrugged his shoulders “nothing of value had been taken as i tell you i am aware of
course that strictly speaking it is a case for the police——”
he paused and the manager murmured without any particular enthusiasm:
“for the police—of course——”
“in any case i was fairly certain that the man would manage to make
good his escape and since nothing was taken why bother with the
police ”
the manager smiled a little “i see that you realize mr mcgrath that i am not at all anxious
to have the police called in from my point of view it is always
disastrous if the newspapers can get hold of anything connected with
a big fashionable hotel such as this they always run it for all it is
worth no matter how insignificant the real subject matter may be ”
“quite so ” agreed anthony “now i told you that nothing of value had
been taken and that was perfectly true in a sense nothing of any
value to the thief was taken but he got hold of something which is of
considerable value to me ”
“ah ”
“letters you understand ”
an expression of superhuman discretion only to be achieved by a
frenchman settled down upon the manager’s face “i comprehend ” he murmured “but perfectly naturally it is not a
matter for the police ”
“we are quite agreed upon that point but you will understand that
i have every intention of recovering these letters in the part of
the world where i come from people are used to doing things for
themselves what i require from you therefore is the fullest possible
information you can give me about this waiter giuseppe ”
“i see no objection to that ” said the manager after a moment or two’s
pause “i cannot give you the information offhand of course but if
you will return in half an hour’s time i will have everything ready to
lay before you ”
“thank you very much that will suit me admirably ”
in half an hour’s time anthony returned to the office again to find
that the manager had been as good as his word jotted down upon a piece
of paper were all the relevant facts known about giuseppe manelli “he came to us you see about three months ago a skilled and
experienced waiter has given complete satisfaction he has been in
england about five years ”
together the two men ran over a list of the hotels and restaurants
where the italian had worked one fact struck anthony as being possibly
of significance at two of the hotels in question there had been
serious robberies during the time that giuseppe was employed there though no suspicion of any kind had attached to him in either case still the fact was significant was giuseppe merely a clever hotel thief had his search of anthony’s
suit-case been merely part of his habitual professional tactics he
might just possibly have had the packet of letters in his hand at the
moment when anthony switched on the light and have shoved it into his
pocket mechanically so as to have his hands free in that case the
thing was mere plain or garden robbery against that there was to be put the man’s excitement of the evening
before when he had caught sight of the papers lying on the table there
had been no money or object of value there such as would excite the
cupidity of an ordinary thief no anthony felt convinced that giuseppe had been acting as a tool
for some outside agency with the information supplied to him by the
manager it might be possible to learn something about giuseppe’s
private life and so finally track him down he gathered up the sheet
of paper and rose “thank you very much indeed it’s quite unnecessary to ask i suppose whether giuseppe is still in the hotel ”
the manager smiled “his bed was not slept in and all his things have been left behind he
must have rushed straight out after his attack upon you i don’t think
there is much chance of our seeing him again ”
“i imagine not well thank you very much indeed i shall be staying on
here for the present ”
“i hope you will be successful in your task but i confess that i am
rather doubtful ”
“i always hope for the best ”
one of anthony’s first proceedings was to question some of the other
waiters who had been friendly with giuseppe but he obtained very
little to go upon he wrote out an advertisement on the lines he had
planned and had it sent to five of the most widely read newspapers he
was just about to go out and visit the restaurant at which giuseppe had
been previously employed when the telephone rang anthony took up the
receiver “hullo what is it ”
a toneless voice replied “am i speaking to mr mcgrath ”
“you are who are you ”
“this is messrs balderson and hodgkins just a minute please i will
put you through to mr balderson ”
“our worthy publishers ” thought anthony “so they are getting worried
too are they they needn’t there’s a week to run still ”
a hearty voice struck suddenly upon his ear “hullo that mr mcgrath ”
“speaking ”
“i’m mr balderson of balderson and hodgkins what about that
manuscript mr mcgrath ”
“well ” said anthony “what about it ”
“everything about it i understand mr mcgrath that you have just
arrived in this country from south africa that being so you can’t
possibly understand the position there’s going to be trouble about
that manuscript mr mcgrath big trouble sometimes i wish we’d never
said we’d handle it ”
“indeed ”
“i assure you it’s so at present i’m anxious to get it into my
possession as quickly as possible so as to have a couple of copies
made then if the original is destroyed—well no harm will be done ”
“dear me ” said anthony “yes i expect it sounds absurd to you mr mcgrath but i assure
you you don’t appreciate the situation there’s a determined effort
being made to prevent its ever reaching this office i say to you quite
frankly and without humbug that if you attempt to bring it yourself
it’s ten to one that you’ll never get here ”
“i doubt that ” said anthony “when i want to get anywhere i usually
do ”
“you’re up against a very dangerous lot of people i wouldn’t have
believed it myself a month ago i tell you mr mcgrath we’ve been
bribed and threatened and cajoled by one lot and another until we don’t
know whether we’re on our heads or our heels my suggestion is that you
do not attempt to bring the manuscript here one of our people will
call upon you at the hotel and take possession of it ”
“and supposing the gang does him in ” asked anthony “the responsibility would then be ours—not yours you would have
delivered it to our representative and obtained a written discharge the cheque for—er—a thousand pounds which we are instructed to hand
to you will not be available until wednesday next by the terms of our
agreement with the executors of the late—er—author—you know whom i
mean but if you insist i will send my own cheque for that amount by
the messenger ”
anthony reflected for a minute or two he had intended to keep the
memoirs until the last day of grace because he was anxious to see for
himself what all the fuss was about nevertheless he realized the
force of the publisher’s arguments “all right ” he said with a little sigh “have it your own way send
your man along and if you don’t mind sending that cheque as well
i’d rather have it now as i may be going out of england before next
wednesday ”
“certainly mr mcgrath our representative will call upon you first
thing to-morrow morning it will be wiser not to send anyone direct
from the office our mr holmes lives in south london he will call
in on his way to us and will give you a receipt for the package i
suggest that to-night you should place a dummy packet in the manager’s
safe your enemies will get to hear of this and it will prevent any
attack being made upon your apartments to-night ”
“very well i will do as you direct ”
anthony hung up the receiver with a thoughtful face then he went on with his interrupted plan of seeking news of the
slippery giuseppe he drew a complete blank however giuseppe had
worked at the restaurant in question but nobody seemed to know
anything of his private life or associates “but i’ll get you my lad ” murmured anthony between his teeth “i’ll
get you yet it’s only a matter of time ”
his second night in london was entirely peaceful at nine o’clock the following morning the card of mr holmes from
messrs balderson and hodgkins was sent up and mr holmes followed
it a small fair man with a quiet manner anthony handed over the
manuscript and received in exchange a cheque for a thousand pounds mr holmes packed up the manuscript in the small brown bag he carried wished anthony good morning and departed the whole thing seemed very
tame “but perhaps he’ll be murdered on the way there ” anthony murmured
aloud as he stared idly out of the window “i wonder now—i very much
wonder ”
he put the cheque in an envelope enclosed a few lines of writing
with it and sealed it up carefully jimmy who had been more or less
in funds at the time of his encounter with anthony at bulawayo had
advanced him a substantial sum of money which was as yet practically
untouched “if one’s job’s done with the other isn’t ” said anthony to himself “up to now i’ve bungled it but never say die i think that suitably
disguised i shall go and have a look at 487 pont street ”
he packed his belongings went down and paid his bill and ordered his
luggage to be put on a taxi suitably rewarding those who stood in his
path most of whom had done nothing whatever materially to add to his
comfort he was on the point of being driven off when a small boy
rushed down the steps with a letter “just come for you this very minute sir ”
with a sigh anthony produced yet another shilling the taxi groaned
heavily and jumped forward with a hideous crashing of gears and
anthony opened the letter it was rather a curious document he had to read it four times before
he could be sure of what it was all about put in plain english (the
letter was not in plain english but in the peculiar involved style
common to missives issued by government officials) it presumed that mr mcgrath was arriving in england from south africa to-day—thursday it
referred obliquely to the memoirs of count stylptitch and begged mr mcgrath to do nothing in the matter until he had had a confidential
conversation with mr george lomax and certain other parties whose
magnificence was vaguely hinted at it also contained a definite
invitation to go down to chimneys as the guest of lord caterham on the
following day friday a mysterious and thoroughly obscure communication anthony enjoyed it
very much “dear old england ” he murmured affectionately “two days behind the
times as usual rather a pity still i can’t go down to chimneys
under false pretences i wonder though if there’s an inn handy mr anthony cade might stay at the inn without anyone being the wiser ”
he leaned out of the window and gave new directions to the taxi
driver who acknowledged them with a snort of contempt the taxi drew up before one of london’s more obscure hostelries the
fare however was paid on a scale befitting its point of departure having booked a room in the name of anthony cade anthony passed into
a dingy writing-room took out a sheet of notepaper stamped with the
legend hotel blitz and wrote rapidly he explained that he had arrived on the preceding tuesday that he
had handed over the manuscript in question to messrs balderson and
hodgkins and he regretfully declined the kind invitation of lord
caterham as he was leaving england almost immediately he signed the
letter “yours faithfully james mcgrath ”
“and now ” said anthony as he affixed the stamp to the envelope “to
business exit james mcgrath and enter anthony cade ”"
Chapter 8,"8
a dead man
on that same thursday afternoon virginia revel had been playing tennis
at ranelagh all the way back to pont street as she lay back in the
long luxurious limousine a little smile played upon her lips as
she rehearsed her part in the forthcoming interview of course it
was within the bounds of possibility that the blackmailer might not
reappear but she felt pretty certain that he would she had shown
herself an easy prey well perhaps this time there would be a little
surprise for him when the car drew up at the house she turned to speak to the chauffeur
before going up the steps “how’s your wife walton i forgot to ask ”
“better i think ma’am the doctor said he’d look in and see her about
half-past six will you be wanting the car again ”
virginia reflected for a minute “i shall be away for the week-end i’m going by the 6 40 from
paddington but i shan’t need you again—a taxi will do for that i’d
rather you saw the doctor if he thinks it would do your wife good to
go away for the week-end take her somewhere walton i’ll stand the
expense ”
cutting short the man’s thanks with an impatient nod of the head virginia ran up the steps delved into her bag in search of her
latchkey remembered she hadn’t got it with her and hastily rang the
bell it was not answered at once but as she waited there a young man came
up the steps he was shabbily dressed and carried in his hand a sheaf
of leaflets he held one out to virginia with the legend on it plainly
visible: “why did i serve my country ” in his left hand he held a
collecting-box “i can’t buy two of those awful poems in one day ” said virginia
pleadingly “i bought one this morning i did indeed honour bright ”
the young man threw back his head and laughed virginia laughed with
him running her eyes carelessly over him she thought him a more
pleasing specimen than usual of london’s unemployed she liked his
brown face and the lean hardness of him she went so far as to wish
she had a job for him but at that moment the door opened and immediately virginia forgot all
about the problem of the unemployed for to her astonishment the door
was opened by her own maid élise “where’s chilvers ” she demanded sharply as she stepped into the hall “but he is gone madame with the others ”
“what others gone where ”
“but to datchet madame—to the cottage as your telegram said ”
“my telegram ” said virginia utterly at sea “did not madame send a telegram surely there can be no mistake it
came but an hour ago ”
“i never sent any telegram what did it say ”
“i believe it is still on the table _là-bas_ ”
élise retired pounced upon it and brought it to her mistress in
triumph “_voilà_ madame ”
the telegram was addressed to chilvers and ran as follows:
“please take household down to cottage at once and make preparations
for week-end party there catch 5 49 train ”
there was nothing unusual about it it was just the sort of message she
herself had frequently sent before when she had arranged a party at
her riverside bungalow on the spur of the moment she always took the
whole household down leaving an old woman as caretaker chilvers would
not have seen anything wrong with the message and like a good servant
had carried out his orders faithfully enough “me i remained ” explained élise “knowing that madame would wish me
to pack for her ”
“it’s a silly hoax ” cried virginia flinging down the telegram
angrily “you know perfectly well élise that i am going to chimneys i told you so this morning ”
“i thought madame had changed her mind sometimes that does happen does it not madame ”
virginia admitted the truth of the accusation with a half smile she
was busy trying to find a reason for this extraordinary practical joke élise cut forward a suggestion “_mon dieu _” she cried clasping her hands “if it should be the
malefactors the thieves they send the bogus telegram and get the
_domestiques_ all out of the house and then they rob it ”
“i suppose that might be it ” said virginia doubtfully “yes yes madame that is it without a doubt every day you read in
the papers of such things madame will ring up the police at once—at
once—before they arrive and cut our throats ”
“don’t get so excited élise they won’t come and cut our throats at
six o’clock in the afternoon ”
“madame i implore you let me run out and fetch a policeman now at
once ”
“what on earth for don’t be silly élise go up and pack my things
for chimneys if you haven’t already done it the new cailleuax evening
dress and the white crêpe marocain and—yes the black velvet—black
velvet is so political is it not ”
“madame looks ravishing in the eau de nil satin ” suggested élise her
professional instincts reasserting themselves “no i won’t take that hurry up élise there’s a good girl we’ve got
very little time i’ll send a wire to chilvers at datchet and i’ll
speak to the policeman on the beat as we go out and tell him to keep an
eye on the place don’t start rolling your eyes again élise—if you
get so frightened before anything has happened what would you do if a
man jumped out from some dark corner and stuck a knife into you ”
élise gave vent to a shrill squeak and beat a speedy retreat up the
stairs darting nervous glances over each shoulder as she went virginia made a face at her retreating back and crossed the hall to
the little study where the telephone was élise’s suggestion of ringing
up the police station seemed to her a good one and she intended to act
upon it without any further delay she opened the study door and crossed to the telephone then with
her hand on the receiver she stopped a man was sitting in the big
arm-chair sitting in a curious huddled position in the stress of the
moment she had forgotten all about her expected visitor apparently he
had fallen asleep whilst waiting for her she came right up to the chair a slightly mischievous smile upon her
face and then suddenly the smile faded the man was not asleep _he was dead _
she knew it at once knew it instinctively even before her eyes had
seen and noted the small shining pistol lying on the floor the
little-singed hole just above the heart with the dark stain round it and the horrible dropped jaw she stood quite still her hands pressed to her sides in the silence
she heard élise running down the stairs “madame madame ”
“well what is it ”
she moved quickly to the door her whole instinct was to conceal what
had happened—for the moment anyway—from élise élise would promptly
go into hysterics she knew that well enough and she felt a great need
for calm and quiet in which to think things out “madame would it not be better if i should draw the chain across the
door these malefactors at any minute they may arrive ”
“yes if you like anything you like ”
she heard the rattle of the chain and then élise running upstairs
again and drew a long breath of relief she looked at the man in the chair and then at the telephone her
course was quite clear she must ring up the police at once but still she did not do so she stood quite still paralysed with
horror and with a host of conflicting ideas rushing through her brain the bogus telegram had it something to do with this supposing
élise had not stayed behind she would have let herself in—that is presuming she had had her latchkey with her as usual to find herself
alone in the house with a murdered man—a man whom she had permitted to
blackmail her on a former occasion of course she had an explanation of
that; but thinking of that explanation she was not quite easy in her
mind she remembered how frankly incredible george had found it would
other people think the same those letters now—of course she hadn’t
written them but would it be so easy to prove that she put her hands on her forehead squeezing them tight together “i must think ” said virginia “i simply must think ”
who had let the man in surely not élise if she had done so she would
have been sure to have mentioned the fact at once the whole thing
seemed more and more mysterious as she thought about it there was
really only one thing to be done—ring up the police she stretched out her hand to the telephone and suddenly she thought
of george a man—that was what she wanted—an ordinary level-headed unemotional man who would see things in their proper proportion and
point out to her the best course to take then she shook her head not george the first thing george would think
of would be his own position he would hate being mixed up in this
kind of business george wouldn’t do at all then her face softened bill of course without more ado she rang up
bill she was informed that he had left half an hour ago for chimneys “oh damn ” cried virginia jamming down the receiver it was horrible
to be shut up with a dead body and to have no one to speak to and at that minute the front-door bell rang virginia jumped in a few minutes it rang again élise she knew was
upstairs packing and wouldn’t hear it virginia went out in the hall drew back the chain and undid all the
bolts that élise had fastened in her zeal then with a long breath she threw open the door on the steps was the unemployed young man virginia plunged headlong with a relief born of overstrung nerves “come in ” she said “i think that perhaps i’ve got a job for you ”
she took him into the dining-room pulled toward a chair for him sat
down herself facing him and stared at him very attentively “excuse me ” she said “but are you—i mean——”
“eton and oxford ” said the young man “that’s what you wanted to ask
me wasn’t it ”
“something of the kind ” admitted virginia “come down in the world entirely through my own incapacity to stick to
regular work this isn’t regular work you’re offering me i hope ”
a smile hovered for a moment on her lips “it’s very irregular ”
“good ” said the young man in a tone of satisfaction virginia noted his bronzed face and long lean body with approval “you see ” she explained “i’m in rather a hole and most of my friends
are—well rather high up they’ve all got something to lose ”
“i’ve nothing whatever to lose so go ahead what’s the trouble ”
“there’s a dead man in the next room ” said virginia “he’s been
murdered and i don’t know what to do about it ”
she blurted out the words as simply as a child might have done the young man went up enormously in her estimation by the way he
accepted her statement he might have been used to hearing a similar
announcement made every day of his life “excellent ” he said with a trace of enthusiasm “i’ve always wanted
to do a bit of amateur detective work shall we go and view the body or will you give me the facts first ”
“i think i’d better give you the facts ” she paused for a moment to
consider how best to condense her story and then began speaking
quietly and concisely “this man came to the house for the first time yesterday and asked to
see me he had certain letters with him—love letters signed with my
name——”
“but which weren’t written by you ” put in the young man quietly virginia looked at him in some astonishment
“how did you know that ”
“oh i deduced it but go on ”
“he wanted to blackmail me—and i—well i don’t know if you’ll
understand but i—let him ”
she looked at him appealingly and he nodded his head reassuringly “of course i understand you wanted to see what it felt like ”
“how frightfully clever of you that’s just what i did feel ”
“i _am_ clever ” said the young man modestly “but mind you very
few people would understand that point of view most people you see haven’t got any imagination ”
“i suppose that’s so i told this man to come back to-day—at six
o’clock i arrived home from ranelagh to find that a bogus telegram had
got all the servants except my maid out of the house then i walked
into the study and found the man shot ”
“who let him in ”
“i don’t know i think if my maid had done so she would have told me ”
“does she know what has happened ”
“i have told her nothing ”
the young man nodded and rose to his feet “and now to view the body ” he said briskly “but i’ll tell you
this—on the whole it’s always best to tell the truth one lie involves
you in such a lot of lies—and continuous lying is so monotonous ”
“then you advise me to ring up the police ”
“probably but we’ll just have a look at the fellow first ”
virginia led the way out the room on the threshold she paused looking
back at him “by the way ” she said “you haven’t told me your name yet ”
“my name my name’s anthony cade ”"
Chapter 9,"9
anthony disposes of a body
anthony followed virginia out of the room smiling a little to himself events had taken quite an unexpected turn but as he bent over the
figure in the chair he grew grave again “he’s still warm ” he said sharply “he was killed less than half an
hour ago ”
“just before i came in ”
“exactly ”
he stood upright drawing his brows together in a frown then he asked
a question of which virginia did not at once see the drift:
“your maid’s not been in this room of course ”
“no ”
“does she know that you’ve been into it ”
“why—yes i came to the door to speak to her ”
“after you’d found the body ”
“yes ”
“and you said nothing ”
“would it have been better if i had i thought she would go into
hysterics—she’s french you know and easily upset—i wanted to think
over the best thing to do ”
anthony nodded but did not speak “you think it a pity i can see ”
“well it was rather unfortunate mrs revel if you and the maid had
discovered the body together immediately on your return it would have
simplified matters very much the man would then definitely have been
shot _before_ your return to the house ”
“whilst now they might say he was shot _after_—i see—”
he watched her taking in the idea and was confirmed in his first
impression of her formed when she had spoken to him on the steps
outside besides beauty she possessed courage and brains virginia was so engrossed in the puzzle presented to her that it did
not occur to her to wonder at this strange man’s ready use of her name “why didn’t élise hear the shot i wonder ” she murmured anthony pointed to the open window as a loud backfire came from a
passing car “there you are london’s not the place to notice a pistol shot ”
virginia turned with a little shudder to the body in the chair “he looks like an italian ” she remarked curiously “he is an italian ” said anthony “i should say that his regular
profession was that of a waiter he only did blackmailing in his spare
time his name might very possibly be giuseppe ”
“good heavens ” cried virginia “is this sherlock holmes ”
“no ” said anthony regretfully “i’m afraid it’s just plain or garden
cheating i’ll tell you all about it presently now you say this man
showed you some letters and asked you for money did you give him any ”
“yes i did ”
“how much ”
“forty pounds ”
“that’s bad ” said anthony but without manifesting any undue surprise “now let’s have a look at the telegram ”
virginia picked it up from the table and gave it to him she saw his
face grow grave as he looked at it “what’s the matter ”
he held it out pointing silently to the place of origin “barnes ” he said “and you were at ranelagh this afternoon what’s to
prevent you having sent it off yourself ”
virginia felt fascinated by his words it was as though a net was
closing tighter and tighter round her he was forcing her to see all
the things which she had felt dimly at the back of her mind anthony took out his handkerchief and wound it round his hand then he
picked up the pistol “we criminals have to be so careful ” he said apologetically “fingerprints you know ”
suddenly she saw his whole figure stiffen his voice when he spoke had altered it was terse and curt “mrs revel ” he said “have you ever seen this pistol before ”
“no ” said virginia wonderingly “are you sure of that ”
“quite sure ”
“have you a pistol of your own ”
“no ”
“have you ever had one ”
“no never ”
“you are sure of that ”
“quite sure ”
he stared at her steadily for a minute and virginia stared back in
complete surprise at his tone then with a sigh he relaxed “that’s odd ” he said “how do you account for this ”
he held out the pistol it was a small dainty article almost a
toy—though capable of doing deadly work engraved on it was the name
virginia “oh it’s impossible ” cried virginia her astonishment was so genuine that anthony could but believe in it “sit down ” he said quietly “there’s more in this than there seemed
to be first go off to begin with what’s our hypothesis there are
only two possible ones there is of course the real virginia of the
letters she may have somehow or other tracked him down shot him dropped the pistol stolen the letters and taken herself off that’s
quite possible isn’t it ”
“i suppose so ” said virginia unwillingly “the other hypothesis is a good deal more interesting whoever wished
to kill giuseppe wished also to incriminate you—in fact that may have
been their main object they could get _him_ easily enough anywhere but they took extraordinary pains and trouble to get him _here_ and
whoever they were they knew all about you your cottage at datchet your usual household arrangements and the fact that you were at
ranelagh this afternoon it seems an absurd question but have you any
enemies mrs revel ”
“of course i haven’t—not that kind anyway ”
“the question is ” said anthony “what are we going to do now there
are two courses open to us a: ring up the police tell the whole
story and trust to your unassailable position in the world and
your hitherto blameless life b: an attempt on my part to dispose
successfully of the body naturally my private inclinations urge me
to b i’ve always wanted to see if i couldn’t conceal a crime with
the necessary cunning but have had a squeamish objection to shedding
blood on the whole i expect a’s the soundest then there’s a sort of
bowdlerized a ring up the police etc but suppress the pistol and
the blackmailing letters—that is if they are on him still ”
anthony ran rapidly through the dead man’s pockets “he’s been stripped clean ” he announced “there’s not a thing on him there’ll be dirty work at the crossroads over those letters yet hullo what’s this hole in the lining—something got caught there torn
roughly out and a scrap of paper left behind ”
he drew out the scrap of paper as he spoke and brought it over to the
light virginia joined him “pity we haven’t got the rest of it ” he muttered “_chimneys 11 45
thursday_—sounds like an appointment ”
“chimneys ” cried virginia “how extraordinary ”
“why extraordinary rather high toned for such a low fellow ”
“i’m going to chimneys this evening at least i was ”
anthony wheeled round on her “what’s that say that again ”
“i was going to chimneys this evening ” repeated virginia anthony stared at her “i begin to see at least i may be wrong—but it’s an idea suppose
some one wanted badly to prevent your going to chimneys ”
“my cousin george lomax does ” said virginia with a smile “but i can’t
seriously suspect george of murder ”
anthony did not smile he was lost in thought “if you ring up the police it’s good-bye to any idea of getting to
chimneys to-day—or even to-morrow and i should like you to go to
chimneys i fancy it will disconcert our unknown friends mrs revel will you put yourself in my hands ”
“it’s to be plan b then ”
“it’s to be plan b the first thing is to get that maid of yours out of
the house can you manage that ”
“easily ”
virginia went out in the hall and called up the stairs “élise élise ”
“madame ”
anthony heard a rapid colloquy and then the front door opened and
shut virginia came back into the room “she’s gone i sent her for some special scent—told her the shop in
question was open until eight it won’t be of course she’s to follow
after me by the next train without coming back here ”
“good ” said anthony approvingly “we can now proceed to the disposal
of the body it’s a time-worn method but i’m afraid i shall have to
ask you if there’s such a thing in the house as a trunk ”
“of course there is come down to the basement and take your choice ”
there was a variety of trunks in the basement anthony selected a solid
affair of suitable size “i’ll attend to this part of it ” he said tactfully “you go upstairs
and get ready to start ”
virginia obeyed she slipped out of her tennis kit put on a soft brown
travelling dress and a delightful little orange hat and came down to
find anthony waiting in the hall with a neatly strapped trunk beside
him “i should like to tell you the story of my life ” he remarked “but
it’s going to be rather a busy evening now this is what you’ve got
to do call a taxi have your luggage put on it including the trunk drive to paddington there have the trunk put in the left luggage
office i shall be on the platform as you pass me drop the cloak
room ticket i will pick it up and pretend to return it to you but in
reality i shall keep it go on to chimneys and leave the rest to me ”
“it’s awfully good of you ” said virginia “it’s really dreadful of me
saddling a perfect stranger with a dead body like this ”
“i like it ” returned anthony nonchalantly “if one of my friends jimmy mcgrath were here he’d tell you that anything of this kind
suits me down to the ground ”
virginia was staring at him “what name did you say jimmy mcgrath ”
anthony returned her glance keenly “yes why have you heard of him ”
“yes—and quite lately ” she paused irresolutely and then went on “mr cade i must talk to you can’t you come down to chimneys ”
“you’ll see me before very long mrs revel—i’ll tell you that now exit conspirator a by back door slinkingly exit conspirator b in
blaze of glory by front door to taxi ”
the plan went through without a hitch anthony having picked up a
second taxi was on the platform and duly retrieved the fallen ticket he then departed in search of a somewhat battered second-hand morris
cowley which he had acquired earlier in the day in case it should be
necessary to his plans returning to paddington in this he handed the ticket to the porter who got the trunk out of the cloak room and wedged it securely at the
back of the car anthony drove off his objective now was out of london through notting hill shepherd’s
bush down goldhawk road through brentford and hounslow till he came
to the long stretch of road mid-way between hounslow and staines it was a well-frequented road with motors passing continually no
footmarks or tyre marks were likely to show anthony stopped the car at
a certain spot getting down he first obscured the number-plate with
mud then waiting until he heard no car coming in either direction he opened the trunk heaved out giuseppe’s body and laid it neatly
down by the side of the road on the inside of a curve so that the
headlights of passing motors would not strike on it then he entered the car again and drove away the whole business had
occupied exactly one minute and a half he made a détour to the right returning to london by way of burnham beeches there again he halted
the car and choosing a giant of the forest he deliberately climbed the
huge tree it was something of a feat even for anthony to one of the
topmost branches he affixed a small brown-paper parcel concealing it
in a little niche close to the bole “a very clever way of disposing of the pistol ” said anthony to himself
with some approval “everybody hunts about on the ground and drags
ponds but there are very few people in england who could climb that
tree ”
next back to london and paddington station here he left the trunk—at
the other cloak room this time the one on the arrival side he thought
longingly of such things as good rumpsteaks juicy chops and large
masses of fried potatoes but he shook his head ruefully glancing at
his wrist watch he fed the morris with a fresh supply of petrol and
then took the road once more north this time it was just after half-past eleven that he brought the car to rest in
the road adjoining the park of chimneys jumping out he scaled the wall
easily enough and set out towards the house it took him longer than
he thought and presently he broke into a run a great grey mass loomed
up out of the darkness—the venerable pile of chimneys in the distance
a stable clock chimed the three quarters 11 45—the time mentioned on the scrap of paper anthony was on the
terrace now looking up at the house everything seemed dark and quiet “they go to bed early these politicians ” he murmured to himself and suddenly a sound smote upon his ears—the sound of a shot anthony
spun round quickly the sound had come from within the house—he was
sure of that he waited a minute but everything was still as death finally he went up to one of the long french windows from where he
judged the sound that had startled him had come he tried the handle it was locked he tried some of the other windows listening intently
all the while but the silence remained unbroken in the end he told himself that he must have imagined the sound or
perhaps mistaken a stray shot coming from a poacher in the woods he
turned and retraced his steps across the park vaguely dissatisfied and
uneasy he looked back at the house and whilst he looked a light sprang up in
one of the windows on the first floor in another minute it went out
again and the whole place was in darkness once more "
Chapter 10,"10
chimneys
inspector badgworthy in his office time 8 30 a m a tall portly
man inspector badgworthy with a heavy regulation tread inclined to
breathe hard in moments of professional strain in attendance constable
johnson very new to the force with a downy unfledged look about him like a human chicken the telephone on the table rang sharply and the inspector took it up
with his usual portentous gravity of action “yes police station market basing inspector badgworthy speaking what ”
slight alteration in the inspector’s manner as he is greater than
johnson so others are greater than inspector badgworthy “speaking my lord i beg your pardon my lord i didn’t quite hear
what you said ”
long pause during which the inspector listens quite a variety of
expressions passing over his usually impassive countenance finally he
lays down the receiver after a brief “at once my lord ”
he turned to johnson seeming visibly swelled with importance “from his lordship—at chimneys—murder ”
“murder ” echoed johnson suitably impressed “murder it is ” said the inspector with great satisfaction “why there’s never been a murder here—not that i’ve ever heard
of—except the time that tom pearse shot his sweetheart ”
“and that in a manner of speaking wasn’t murder at all but drink ”
said the inspector deprecatingly “he weren’t hanged for it ” agreed johnson gloomily “but this is the
real thing is it sir ”
“it is johnson one of his lordship’s guests a foreign gentleman discovered shot open window and footprints outside ”
“i’m sorry it were a foreigner ” said johnson with some regret it made the murder seem less real foreigners johnson felt were
liable to be shot “his lordship’s in a rare taking ” continued the inspector “we’ll get
hold of dr cartwright and take him up with us right away i hope to
goodness no one will get messing with those footprints ”
badgworthy was in a seventh heaven a murder at chimneys inspector
badgworthy in charge of the case the police have a clue sensational
arrest promotion and kudos for the aforementioned inspector “that is ” said inspector badgworthy to himself “if scotland yard
doesn’t come butting in ”
the thought damped him momentarily it seemed so extremely likely to
happen under the circumstances they stopped at dr cartwright’s and the doctor who was a
comparatively young man displayed a keen interest his attitude was
almost exactly that of johnson “why bless my soul ” he exclaimed “we haven’t had a murder here since
the time of tom pearse ”
all three of them got into the doctor’s little car and started
off briskly for chimneys as they passed the local inn _the jolly
cricketers_ the doctor noticed a man standing in the doorway “stranger ” he remarked “rather a nice-looking fellow wonder how long
he’s been here and what he’s doing staying at the _cricketers_ i
haven’t seen him about at all he must have arrived last night ”
“he didn’t come by train ” said johnson johnson’s brother was the local railway porter and johnson was
therefore always well up in arrivals and departures “who was there for chimneys yesterday ” asked the inspector “lady eileen she come down by the 3 40 and two gentlemen with her an american gent and a young army chap—neither of them with valets his lordship come down with a foreign gentleman the one that’s been
shot as likely as not by the 5 40 and the foreign gentleman’s valet mr eversleigh come by the same train mrs revel came by the 7 25 and
another foreign-looking gentleman came by it too one with a bald head
and a hook nose mrs revel’s maid came by the 8 56 ”
johnson paused out of breath “and there was no one for the _cricketers_ ”
johnson shook his head “he must have come by car then ” said the inspector “johnson make
a note to institute inquiries at the _cricketers_ on your way back we want to know all about any strangers he was very sunburnt that
gentleman likely as not he’s come from foreign parts too ”
the inspector nodded his head with great sagacity as though to imply
that that was the sort of wide-awake man he was—not to be caught
napping under any consideration the car passed in through the park gates of chimneys descriptions of
that historic place can be found in any guide book it is also no 3
in _historic homes of england_ price 21s on thursdays chars-à-bancs
come over from middlingham and view those portions of it which are open
to the public in view of all these facilities to describe chimneys
would be superfluous they were received at the door by a white-headed butler whose demeanour
was perfect “we are not accustomed ” it seemed to say “to having murder committed
within these walls but these are evil days let us meet disaster with
perfect calm and pretend with our dying breath that nothing out of the
usual has occurred ”
“his lordship ” said the butler “is expecting you this way if you
please ”
he led them to a small cosy room which was lord caterham’s refuge from
the magnificence elsewhere and announced them “the police my lord and dr cartwright ”
lord caterham was pacing up and down in a visibly agitated state “ha inspector you’ve turned up at last i’m thankful for that how
are you cartwright this is the very devil of a business you know the very devil of a business ”
and lord caterham running his hands through his hair in a frenzied
fashion until it stood upright in little tufts looked even less like a
peer of the realm than usual “where’s the body ” asked the doctor in curt business-like fashion lord caterham turned to him as though relieved at being asked a direct
question “in the council chamber—just where it was found—i wouldn’t have it
touched i believed—er—that that was the correct thing to do ”
“quite right my lord ” said the inspector approvingly he produced a notebook and pencil “and who discovered the body did you ”
“good lord no ” said lord caterham “you don’t think i usually get up
at this unearthly hour in the morning do you no a housemaid found
it she screamed a good deal i believe i didn’t hear her myself then
they came to me about it and of course i got up and came down—and
there it was you know ”
“you recognized the body as that of one of your guests ”
“that’s right inspector ”
“by name ”
this perfectly simple question seemed to upset lord caterham he
opened his mouth once or twice and then shut it again finally he
asked feebly “do you mean—do you mean—what was his name ”
“yes my lord ”
“well ” said lord caterham looking slowly round the room as though
hoping to gain inspiration “his name was—i should say it was—yes decidedly so—count stanislaus ”
there was something so odd about lord caterham’s manner that the
inspector ceased using his pencil and stared at him instead but at
that moment a diversion occurred which seemed highly welcome to the
embarrassed peer the door opened and a girl came into the room she was tall slim and
dark with an attractive boyish face and a very determined manner this was lady eileen brent commonly known as bundle lord caterham’s
eldest daughter she nodded to the others and addressed her father
directly “i’ve got him ” she announced for a moment the inspector was on the point of starting forward
under the impression that the young lady had captured the murderer
red-handed but almost immediately he realized that her meaning was
quite different lord caterham uttered a sigh of relief “that’s a good job what did he say ”
“he’s coming over at once we are to ‘use the utmost discretion ’”
her father made a sound of annoyance “that’s just the sort of idiotic thing george lomax would say however once he comes i shall wash my hands of the whole affair ”
he appeared to cheer up a little at the prospect “and the name of the murdered man was count stanislaus ” queried the
doctor a lightning glance passed between father and daughter and then the
former said with some dignity:
“certainly i said so just now ”
“i asked because you didn’t seem quite sure about it before ” explained
cartwright there was a faint twinkle in his eye and lord caterham looked at him
reproachfully “i’ll take you to the council chamber ” he said more briskly they followed him the inspector bringing up the rear and darting
sharp glances all around him as he went much as though he expected to
find a clue in a picture frame or behind a door lord caterham took a key from his pocket and unlocked a door flinging
it open they all passed into a big room panelled in oak with three
long windows giving on the terrace there was a long refectory table
and a good many oak chests and some beautiful old chairs on the walls
were various paintings of dead and gone caterhams and others near the left-hand wall about half-way between the door and the
window a man was lying on his back his arms flung wide dr cartwright went over and knelt down by the body the inspector
strode across to the windows and examined them in turn the centre
one was closed but not fastened on the steps outside were footprints
leading up to the window and a second set going away again “clear enough ” said the inspector with a nod “but there ought to be
footprints on the inside as well they’d show up plain on this parquet
floor ”
“i think i can explain that ” interposed bundle “the housemaid had
polished half the floor this morning before she saw the body you
see it was dark when she came in here she went straight across to
the windows drew the curtains and began on the floor and naturally
didn’t see the body which is hidden from that side of the room by the
table she didn’t see it until she came right on top of it ”
the inspector nodded “well ” said lord caterham eager to escape “i’ll leave you here inspector you’ll be able to find me if you—er—want me but mr george lomax is coming over from wyverne abbey shortly and he’ll be
able to tell you far more than i could it’s his business really i
can’t explain but he will when he comes ”
lord caterham beat a precipitate retreat without waiting for a reply “too bad for lomax ” he complained “letting me in for this what’s the
matter tredwell ”
the white-haired butler was hovering deferentially at his elbow “i have taken the liberty my lord of advancing the breakfast hour as
far as you are concerned everything is ready in the dining-room ”
“i don’t suppose for a minute i can eat anything ” said lord caterham
gloomily turning his footsteps in that direction “not for a moment ”
bundle slipped her hand through his arm and they entered the
dining-room together on the sideboard were half a score of heavy
silver dishes ingeniously kept hot by patent arrangements “omelet ” said lord caterham lifting each lid in turn “eggs and
bacon kidneys devilled bird haddock cold ham cold pheasant i
don’t like any of these things tredwell ask the cook to poach me an
egg will you ”
“very good my lord ”
tredwell withdrew lord caterham in an absent-minded fashion helped
himself plentifully to kidneys and bacon poured himself out a cup of
coffee and sat down at the long table bundle was already busy with a
plateful of eggs and bacon “i’m damned hungry ” said bundle with her mouth full “it must be the
excitement ”
“it’s all very well for you ” complained her father “you young people
like excitement but i’m in a very delicate state of health avoid all
worry that’s what sir abner willis said—avoid all worry so easy for
a man sitting in his consulting-room in harley street to say that how
can i avoid worry when that ass lomax lands me with a thing like this i ought to have been firm at the time i ought to have put my foot
down ”
with a sad shake of the head lord caterham rose and carved himself a
plate of ham “codders has certainly done it this time ” observed bundle cheerfully “he was almost incoherent over the telephone he’ll be here in a minute
or two spluttering nineteen to the dozen about discretion and hushing
it up ”
lord caterham groaned at the prospect “was he up ” he asked “he told me ” replied bundle “that he had been up and dictating
letters and memoranda ever since seven o’clock ”
“proud of it too ” remarked her father “extraordinarily selfish these public men they make their wretched secretaries get up at the
most unearthly hours in order to dictate rubbish to them if a law was
passed compelling them to stop in bed until eleven what a benefit it
would be to the nation i wouldn’t mind so much if they didn’t talk
such balderdash lomax is always talking to me of my ‘position ’ as if
i had any who wants to be a peer nowadays ”
“nobody ” said bundle “they’d much rather keep a prosperous public
house ”
tredwell reappeared silently with two poached eggs in a little silver
dish which he placed on the table in front of lord caterham “what’s that tredwell ” said the latter looking at them with faint
distaste “poached eggs my lord ”
“i hate poached eggs ” said lord caterham peevishly “they’re so
insipid i don’t like to look at them even take them away will you tredwell ”
“very good my lord ”
tredwell and the poached eggs withdrew as silently as they came “thank god no one gets up early in this house ” remarked lord caterham
devoutly “we shall have to break this to them when they do i suppose ”
he sighed “i wonder who murdered him ” said bundle “and why ”
“that’s not our business thank goodness ” said lord caterham “that’s
for the police to find out not that badgworthy will ever find out
anything on the whole i rather hope it was nosystein ”
“meaning——”
“the all british syndicate ”
“why should mr isaacstein murder him when he’d come down here on
purpose to meet him ”
“high finance ” said lord caterham vaguely “and that reminds me i
shouldn’t be at all surprised if isaacstein wasn’t an early riser he
may blow in upon us at any minute it’s a habit in the city i believe
that however rich you are you always catch the 9 17 ”
the sound of a motor being driven at great speed was heard through the
open window “codders ” cried bundle father and daughter leaned out of the window and hailed the occupant of
the car as it drew up before the entrance “in here my dear fellow in here ” cried lord caterham hastily
swallowing his mouthful of ham george had no intention of climbing in through the window he
disappeared through the front door and reappeared ushered in by
tredwell who withdrew at once “have some breakfast ” said lord caterham shaking him by the hand “what about a kidney ”
george waved the kidney aside impatiently “this is a terrible calamity terrible terrible ”
“it is indeed some haddock ”
“no no it must be hushed up—at all costs it must be hushed up ”
as bundle had prophesied george began to splutter “i understand your feelings ” said lord caterham sympathetically “try
an egg and bacon or some haddock ”
“a totally unforeseen contingency—national calamity—concessions
jeopardized——”
“take time ” said lord caterham “and take some food what you need
is some food to pull you together poached eggs now there were some
poached eggs here a minute or two ago ”
“i don’t want any food ” said george “i’ve had breakfast and even if
i hadn’t had any i shouldn’t want it we must think what is to be done you have told no one as yet ”
“well there’s bundle and myself and the local police and cartwright and all the servants of course ”
george groaned “pull yourself together my dear fellow ” said lord caterham kindly “(i wish you’d have some breakfast ) you don’t seem to realize that
you can’t hush up a dead body it’s got be buried and all that sort of
thing very unfortunate but there it is ”
george became suddenly calm “you are right caterham you have called in the local police you say that will not do we must have battle ”
“battle murder and sudden death ” inquired lord caterham with a
puzzled face “no no you misunderstand me i referred to superintendent battle of
scotland yard a man of the utmost discretion he worked with us in
that deplorable business of the party funds ”
“what was that ” asked lord caterham with some interest but george’s eye had fallen upon bundle as she sat half in and half
out of the window and he remembered discretion just in time he rose “we must waste no time i must send off some wires at once ”
“if you write them out bundle will send them through the telephone ”
george pulled out a fountain pen and began to write with incredible
rapidity he handed the first one to bundle who read it with a great
deal of interest “god what a name ” she remarked “baron how much ”
“baron lolopretjzyl ”
bundle blinked “i’ve got it but it will take some conveying to the post office ”
george continued to write then he handed his labours to bundle and
addressed the master of the house:
“the best thing that you can do caterham——”
“yes ” said lord caterham apprehensively “is to leave everything in my hands ”
“certainly ” said lord caterham with alacrity “just what i was
thinking myself you’ll find the police and dr cartwright in the
council chamber with the—er—with the body you know my dear lomax i place chimneys unreservedly at your disposal do anything you like ”
“thank you ” said george “if i should want to consult you——”
but lord caterham had faded unobtrusively through the farther door bundle had observed his retreat with a grim smile “i’ll send off those telegrams at once ” she said “you know your way
to the council chamber ”
“thank you lady eileen ”
george hurried from the room "
Chapter 11,"11
superintendent battle arrives
so apprehensive was lord caterham of being consulted by george that he
spent the whole morning making a tour of his estate only the pangs of
hunger drew him homeward he also reflected that by now the worst would
surely be over he sneaked into the house quietly by a small side door from there he
slipped neatly into his sanctum he flattered himself that his entrance
had not been observed but there he was mistaken the watchful tredwell
let nothing escape him he presented himself at the door “you’ll excuse me my lord——”
“what is it tredwell ”
“mr lomax my lord is anxious to see you in the library as soon as
you return ”
by this delicate method tredwell conveyed that lord caterham had not
yet returned unless he chose to say so lord caterham sighed and then rose “i suppose it will have to be done sooner or later in the library you
say ”
“yes my lord ”
sighing again lord caterham crossed the wide spaces of his ancestral
home and reached the library door the door was locked as he rattled
the handle it was unlocked from inside opened a little way and the
face of george lomax appeared peering out suspiciously his face changed when he saw who it was “ah caterham come in we were just wondering what had become of you ”
murmuring something vague about duties on the estate repairs for
tenants lord caterham sidled in apologetically there were two other
men in the room one was colonel melrose the chief constable the
other was a squarely built middle-aged man with a face so singularly
devoid of expression as to be quite remarkable “superintendent battle arrived half an hour ago ” explained george “he
has been round with inspector badgworthy and seen dr cartwright he
now wants a few facts from us ”
they all sat down after lord caterham had greeted melrose and
acknowledged his introduction to superintendent battle “i need hardly tell you battle ” said george “that this is a case in
which we must use the utmost discretion ”
the superintendent nodded in an offhand manner that rather took lord
caterham’s fancy “that will be all right mr lomax but no concealments from us i
understand that the dead gentleman was called count stanislaus—at
least that that is the name by which the household knew him now was
that his real name ”
“it was not ”
“what was his real name ”
“prince michael of herzoslovakia ”
battle’s eyes opened just a trifle otherwise he gave no sign “and what if i may ask the question was the purpose of his visit
here just pleasure ”
“there was a further object battle all this in the strictest
confidence of course ”
“yes yes mr lomax ”
“colonel melrose ”
“of course ”
“well then prince michael was here for the express purpose of meeting
mr herman isaacstein a loan was to be arranged on certain terms ”
“which were ”
“i do not know the exact details indeed they had not yet been
arranged but in the event of coming to the throne prince michael
pledged himself to grant certain oil concessions to those companies in
which mr isaacstein is interested the british government was prepared
to support the claim of prince michael to the throne in view of his
pronounced british sympathies ”
“well ” said superintendent battle “i don’t suppose i need go further
into it than that prince michael wanted the money mr isaacstein
wanted oil and the british government was ready to do the heavy
father just one question was anyone else after those concessions ”
“i believe an american group of financiers had made overtures to his
highness ”
“and been turned down eh ”
but george refused to be drawn “prince michael’s sympathies were entirely pro-british ” he repeated superintendent battle did not press the point “lord caterham i understand that this is what occurred yesterday you
met prince michael in town and journeyed down here in company with him the prince was accompanied by his valet a herzoslovakian named boris
anchoukoff but his equerry captain andrassy remained in town the
prince on arriving declared himself greatly fatigued and retired to
the apartments set aside for him dinner was served to him there and
he did not meet the other members of the house party is that correct ”
“quite correct ”
“this morning a housemaid discovered the body at approximately 7 45
a m dr cartwright examined the dead man and found that death was the
result of a bullet fired from a revolver no revolver was found and no
one in the house seems to have heard the shot on the other hand the
dead man’s wrist watch was smashed by the fall and marks the crime as
having been committed at exactly a quarter to twelve now what time
did you retire to bed last night ”
“we went early somehow or other the party didn’t seem to ‘go’ if you
know what i mean superintendent we went up about half-past ten i
should say ”
“thank you now i will ask you lord caterham to give me a description
of all the people staying in the house ”
“but excuse me i thought the fellow who did it came from outside ”
superintendent battle smiled “i dare say he did i dare say he did but all the same i’ve got to
know who was in the house matter of routine you know ”
“well there was prince michael and his valet and mr herman
isaacstein you know all about them then there was mr eversleigh——”
“who works in my department ” put in george condescendingly “and who was acquainted with the real reason of prince michael’s being
here ”
“no i should not say that ” replied george weightily “doubtless
he realized that something was in the wind but i did not think it
necessary to take him fully into my confidence ”
“i see will you go on lord caterham ”
“let me see there was mr hiram fish ”
“who is mr hiram fish ”
“mr fish is an american he brought over a letter of introduction from
mr lucius gott—you’ve heard of lucius gott ”
superintendent battle smiled acknowledgment who had not heard of
lucius c gott the multi-millionaire “he was specially anxious to see my first editions mr gott’s
collection is of course unequalled but i’ve got several treasures
myself this mr fish was an enthusiast mr lomax had suggested that
i ask one or two extra people down here this week-end to make things
seem more natural so i took the opportunity of asking mr fish that
finishes the men as for the ladies there is only mrs revel—and i
expect she brought a maid or something like that then there was my
daughter and of course the children and their nurses and governesses
and all the servants ”
lord caterham paused and took a breath “thank you ” said the detective “a mere matter of routine but
necessary as such ”
“there is no doubt i suppose ” asked george ponderously “that the
murderer entered by the window ”
battle paused for a minute before replying slowly “there were footsteps leading up to the window and footsteps leading
away from it a car stopped outside the park at 11 40 last night at
twelve o’clock a young man arrived at the _jolly cricketers_ in a car and engaged a room he put his boots outside to be cleaned—they were
very wet and muddy as though he had been walking through the long
grass in the park ”
george leant forward eagerly “could not the boots be compared with the footprints ”
“they were ”
“well ”
“they exactly correspond ”
“that settles it ” cried george “we have the murderer the young
man—what is his name by the way ”
“at the inn he gave the name of anthony cade ”
“this anthony cade must be pursued at once and arrested ”
“you won’t need to pursue him ” said superintendent battle “why ”
“because he’s still there ”
“what ”
“curious isn’t it ”
colonel melrose eyed him keenly “what’s in your mind battle out with it ”
“i just say it’s curious that’s all here’s a young man who ought to
cut and run but he doesn’t cut and run he stays here and gives us
every facility for comparing footmarks ”
“what do you think then ”
“i don’t know what to think and that’s a very disturbing state of
mind ”
“do you imagine——” began colonel melrose but broke off as a discreet
knock came at the door george rose and went to it tredwell inwardly suffering from having to
knock at doors in this low fashion stood dignified upon the threshold and addressed his master “excuse me my lord but a gentleman wishes to see you on urgent and
important business connected i understand with this morning’s
tragedy ”
“what’s his name ” asked battle suddenly “his name sir is mr anthony cade but he said it wouldn’t convey
anything to anybody ”
it seemed to convey something to the four men present they all sat up
in varying degrees of astonishment lord caterham began to chuckle “i’m really beginning to enjoy myself show him in tredwell show him
in at once ”"
Chapter 12,"12
anthony tells his story
“mr anthony cade ” announced tredwell “enter suspicious stranger from village inn ” said anthony he made his way toward lord caterham with a kind of instinct rare in
strangers at the same time he summed up the other three men in his
own mind thus: “1 scotland yard 2 local dignitary—probably chief
constable 3 harassed gentleman on the verge of apoplexy—possibly
connected with the government ”
“i must apologize ” continued anthony still addressing lord caterham “for forcing my way in like this i mean but it was rumoured round the
_jolly dog_ or whatever the name of your local pub may be that you
had had a murder up here and as i thought i might be able to throw
some light upon it i came along ”
for a moment or two no one spoke superintendent battle because he was
a man of ripe experience who knew how infinitely better it was to let
every one else speak if they could be persuaded upon to do so colonel
melrose because he was habitually taciturn george because he was in
the habit of having notice given him of the question lord caterham
because he had not the least idea of what to say the silence of the
other three however and the fact that he had been directly addressed finally forced speech upon the last named “er—quite so—quite so ” he said nervously “won’t—you—er—sit down ”
“thank you ” said anthony george cleared his throat portentously “er—when you say you can throw light upon this matter you mean—— ”
“i mean ” said anthony “that i was trespassing upon lord caterham’s
property (for which i hope he will forgive me) last night at about
11 45 and that i actually heard the shot fired i can at any rate fix
the time of the crime for you ”
he looked round at the three in turn his eyes resting longest on
superintendent battle the impassivity of whose face he seemed to
appreciate “but i hardly think that that’s news to you ” he added gently “meaning by that mr cade ” asked battle “just this i put on shoes when i got up this morning later when i
asked for my boots i couldn’t have them some nice young constable had
called round for them so i naturally put two and two together and
hurried up here to clear my character if possible ”
“a very sensible move ” said battle non-committally anthony’s eyes twinkled a little “i appreciate your reticence inspector it is inspector isn’t it ”
lord caterham interposed he was beginning to take a fancy to anthony “superintendent battle of scotland yard this is colonel melrose our
chief constable and mr lomax ”
anthony looked sharply at george “mr george lomax ”
“yes ”
“i think mr lomax ” said anthony “that i had the pleasure of
receiving a letter from you yesterday ”
george stared at him “i think not ” he said coldly but he wished that miss oscar were here miss oscar wrote all his
letters for him and remembered who they were to and what they were
about a great man like george could not possibly remember all these
annoying details “i think mr cade ” he hinted “that you were about to give us
some—er—explanation of what you were doing in the grounds last night
at 11 45 ”
his tone said plainly: “and whatever it may be we are not likely to
believe it ”
“yes mr cade what _were_ you doing ” said lord caterham with lively
interest “well ” said anthony regretfully “i’m afraid it’s rather a long story ”
he drew out his cigarette case “may i ”
lord caterham nodded and anthony lit a cigarette and braced himself
for the ordeal he was aware none better of the peril in which he stood in the short
space of twenty-four hours he had become embroiled in two separate
crimes his actions in connection with the first would not bear looking
into for a second after deliberately disposing of one body and so
defeating the aims of justice he had arrived upon the scene of the
second crime at the exact moment when it was being committed for a
young man looking for trouble he could hardly have done better “south america ” thought anthony to himself “simply isn’t in it with
this ”
he had already decided upon his course of action he was going to tell
the truth—with one trifling alteration and one grave suppression “the story begins ” said anthony “about three weeks ago—in bulawayo mr lomax of course knows where that is—outpost of the empire—‘what
do we know of england who only england know ’ all that sort of thing i
was conversing with a friend of mine a mr james mcgrath—”
he brought out the name slowly with a thoughtful eye on george george
bounded in his seat and repressed an exclamation with difficulty “the upshot of our conversation was that i came to england to carry
out a little commission for mr mcgrath who was unable to go himself since the passage was booked in his name i travelled as james
mcgrath i don’t know what particular kind of offence that was—the
superintendent can tell me i dare say and run me in for so many
months’ hard if necessary ”
“we’ll get on with the story if you please sir ” said battle but his
eyes twinkled a little “on arrival in london i went to the blitz hotel still as james
mcgrath my business in london was to deliver a certain manuscript to a
firm of publishers but almost immediately i received deputations from
the representatives of two political parties of a foreign kingdom the
methods of one were strictly constitutional the methods of the other
were not i dealt with them both accordingly but my troubles were not
over that night my room was broken into and an attempt at burglary
was made by one of the waiters at the hotel ”
“that was not reported to the police i think ” said superintendent
battle “you are right it was not nothing was taken you see but i did
report the occurrence to the manager of the hotel and he will confirm
my story and tell you that the waiter in question decamped rather
abruptly in the middle of the night the next day the publishers
rang me up and suggested that one of their representatives would
call upon me and receive the manuscript i agreed to this and the
arrangement was duly carried out on the following morning since i
have heard nothing further i presume the manuscript reached them
safely yesterday still as james mcgrath i received a letter from mr lomax——”
anthony paused he was by now beginning to enjoy himself george
shifted uneasily “i remember ” he murmured “such a large correspondence the name of
course being different i could not be expected to know and i may
say ” george’s voice rose a little firm in the assurance of moral
stability “that i consider this—this—masquerading as another man in
the highest degree improper i have no doubt no doubt whatever that
you have incurred a severe legal penalty ”
“in this letter ” continued anthony unmoved “mr lomax made various
suggestions concerning the manuscript in my charge he also extended an
invitation to me from lord caterham to join the house party here ”
“delighted to see you my dear fellow ” said that nobleman “better
late than never—eh ”
george frowned at him superintendent battle bent an unmoved eye upon anthony “and is that your explanation of your presence here last night sir ”
he asked “certainly not ” said anthony warmly “when i am asked to stay at a
country-house i don’t scale the wall late at night tramp across the
park and try the downstairs windows i drive up to the front door ring the bell and wipe my feet on the mat i will proceed i replied to
mr lomax’s letter explaining that the manuscript had passed out of
my keeping and therefore regretfully declining lord caterham’s kind
invitation but after i had done so i remembered something which had
up till then escaped my memory ” he paused the moment had come for
skating over thin ice “i must tell you that in my struggle with the
waiter giuseppe i had wrested from him a small bit of paper with some
words scribbled on it they had conveyed nothing to me at the time but
i still had them and the mention of chimneys recalled them to me i
got the torn scrap out and looked at it it was as i had thought here
is the piece of paper gentlemen you can see for yourselves the words
on it are ‘_chimneys 11 45 thursday _’”
battle examined the paper attentively “of course ” continued anthony “the word chimneys might have nothing
whatever to do with this house on the other hand it might and
undoubtedly this giuseppe was a thieving rascal i made up my mind to
motor down here last night satisfy myself that all was as it should
be put up at the inn and call upon lord caterham in the morning and
put him on his guard in case some mischief should be intended during
the week-end ”
“quite so ” said lord caterham encouragingly “quite so ”
“i was late in getting here—had not allowed enough time consequently
i stopped the car climbed over the wall and ran across the park when
i arrived on the terrace the whole house was dark and silent i was
just turning away when i heard a shot i fancied that it came from
inside the house and i ran back crossed the terrace and tried the
windows but they were fastened and there was no sound of any kind
from inside the house i waited a while but the whole place was still
as the grave so i made up my mind that i had made a mistake and that
what i had heard was a stray poacher—quite a natural conclusion to
come to under the circumstances i think ”
“quite natural ” said superintendent battle expressionlessly “i went on to the inn put up as i said—and heard the news
this morning i realized of course that i was a suspicious
character—bound to be under the circumstances and came up here to
tell my story hoping it wasn’t going to be handcuffs for one ”
there was a pause colonel melrose looked sideways at superintendent
battle “i think the story seems clear enough ” he remarked “yes ” said battle “i don’t think we’ll be handing out any handcuffs
this morning ”
“any questions battle ”
“there’s one thing i’d like to know what was this manuscript ”
he looked across at george and the latter replied with a trace of
unwillingness:
“the memoirs of the late count stylptitch you see——”
“you needn’t say anything more ” said battle “i see perfectly ”
he turned to anthony “do you know who it was that was shot mr cade ”
“at the _jolly dog_ it was understood to be a count stanislaus or some
such name ”
“tell him ” said battle laconically to george lomax george was clearly reluctant but he was forced to speak:
“the gentleman who was staying here incognito as count stanislaus was
his highness prince michael of herzoslovakia ”
anthony whistled “that must be deuced awkward ” he remarked superintendent battle who had been watching anthony closely gave a
short grunt as though satisfied of something and rose abruptly to his
feet “there are one or two questions i’d like to ask mr cade ” he
announced “i’ll take him into the council chamber with me if i may ”
“certainly certainly ” said lord caterham “take him anywhere you
like ”
anthony and the detective went out together the body had been removed from the scene of the tragedy there was a
dark stain on the floor where it had lain but otherwise there was
nothing to suggest that a tragedy had ever occurred the sun poured in
through the three windows flooding the room with light and bringing
out the mellow tone of the old panelling anthony looked around him
with approval “very nice ” he commented “nothing much to beat old england is there ”
“did it seem to you at first it was in this room the shot was fired ”
asked the superintendent not replying to anthony’s eulogium “let me see ”
anthony opened the window and went out on the terrace looking up at
the house “yes that’s the room all right ” he said “it’s built out and
occupies all the corner if the shot had been fired anywhere else it
would have sounded from the _left_ but this was from behind me or to
the right if anything that’s why i thought of poachers it’s at the
extremity of the wing you see ”
he stepped back across the threshold and asked suddenly as though the
idea had just struck him:
“but why do you ask you know he was shot here don’t you ”
“ah ” said the superintendent “we never know as much as we’d like to
know but yes he was shot here all right now you said something
about trying the windows didn’t you ”
“yes they were fastened from the inside ”
“how many of them did you try ”
“all three of them ”
“sure of that sir ”
“i’m in the habit of being sure why do you ask ”
“that’s a funny thing ” said the superintendent “what’s a funny thing ”
“when the crime was discovered this morning the middle one was
open—not latched that is to say ”
“whew ” said anthony sinking down on the window seat and taking
out his cigarette case “that’s rather a blow that opens up quite
a different aspect of the case it leaves us two alternatives either he was killed by some one in the house and that some one
unlatched the window after i had gone to make it look like an outside
job—incidentally with me as little willie—or else not to mince
matters i’m lying i dare say you incline to the second possibility but upon my honour you’re wrong ”
“nobody’s going to leave this house until i’m through with them i can
tell you that ” said superintendent battle grimly anthony looked at him keenly “how long have you had the idea that it might be an inside job ” he
asked battle smiled “i’ve had a notion that way all along your trail was a bit
too—flaring if i may put it that way as soon as your boots fitted
the footmarks i began to have my doubts ”
“i congratulate scotland yard ” said anthony lightly but at that moment the moment when battle apparently admitted
anthony’s complete absence of complicity in the crime anthony felt
more than ever the need of being upon his guard superintendent battle
was a very astute officer it would not do to make any slip with
superintendent battle about “that’s where it happened i suppose ” said anthony nodding towards
the dark patch upon the floor “yes ”
“what was he shot with—a revolver ”
“yes but we shan’t know what make until they get the bullet out at the
autopsy ”
“it wasn’t found then ”
“no it wasn’t found ”
“no clues of any kind ”
“well we’ve got this ”
rather after the manner of a conjurer superintendent battle produced
a half-sheet of notepaper and as he did so he again watched anthony
closely without seeming to do so but anthony recognized the design upon it without any sign of
consternation “aha comrades of the red hand again if they’re going to scatter this
sort of thing about they ought to have it lithographed it must be a
frightful nuisance doing every one separately where was this found ”
“underneath the body you’ve seen it before sir ”
anthony recounted to him in detail his short encounter with that
public-spirited association “the idea is i suppose that the comrades did him in ”
“do you think it likely sir ”
“well it would be in keeping with their propaganda but i’ve always
found that those who talk most about blood have never actually seen
it run i shouldn’t have said the comrades had the guts myself and
they’re such picturesque people too i don’t see one of them disguising
himself as a suitable guest for a country house still one never
knows ”
“quite right mr cade one never knows ”
anthony looked suddenly amused “i see the big idea now open window trail of footprints suspicious
stranger at village inn but i can assure you my dear superintendent that whatever i am i am not the local agent of the red hand ”
superintendent battle smiled a little then he played his last card “would you have any objection to seeing the body ” he shot out suddenly “none whatever ” rejoined anthony battle took a key from his pocket and preceding anthony down the
corridor paused at a door and unlocked it it was one of the smaller
drawing-rooms the body lay on a table covered with a sheet superintendent battle waited until anthony was beside him and then
whisked away the sheet suddenly an eager light sprang into his eyes at the half-uttered exclamation and
the start of surprise which the other gave “so you _do_ recognize him mr cade ” he said in a voice that he
strove to render devoid of triumph “i’ve seen him before yes ” said anthony recovering himself “but
not as prince michael obolovitch he purported to come from messrs balderson and hodgkins and he called himself mr holmes ”"
Chapter 13,"13
the american visitor
superintendent battle replaced the sheet with the slightly crest-fallen
air of a man whose best point has fallen flat anthony stood with his
hands in his pockets lost in thought “so that’s what old lollipop meant when he talked about ‘other means ’”
he murmured at last “i beg your pardon mr cade ”
“nothing superintendent forgive my abstraction you see i—or rather
my friend jimmy mcgrath has been very neatly done out of a thousand
pounds ”
“a thousand pounds is a nice sum of money ” said battle “it isn’t the thousand pounds so much ” said anthony “though i agree
with you that it’s a nice sum of money it’s being done that maddens
me i handed over that manuscript like a little woolly lamb it hurts superintendent indeed it hurts ”
the detective said nothing “well well ” said anthony “regrets are vain and all may not yet be
lost i’ve only got to get hold of dear old stylptitch’s reminiscences
between now and next wednesday and all will be gas and gaiters ”
“would you mind coming back to the council chamber mr cade there’s
one little thing i want to point out to you ”
back in the council chamber the detective strode over at once to the
middle window “i’ve been thinking mr cade this particular window is very stiff very stiff indeed you might have been mistaken in thinking that it was
fastened it might just have stuck i’m sure—yes i’m almost sure that you _were_ mistaken ”
anthony eyed him keenly “and supposing i say that i’m quite sure i was not ”
“don’t you think you could have been ” said battle looking at him very
steadily “well to oblige you superintendent yes ”
battle smiled in a satisfied fashion “you’re quick in the uptake sir and you’ll have no objection to
saying so careless like at a suitable moment ”
“none whatever i——”
he paused as battle gripped his arm the superintendent was bent
forward listening enjoining silence on anthony with a gesture he tiptoed noiselessly to
the door and flung it suddenly open on the threshold stood a tall man with black hair neatly parted in the
middle china blue eyes with a particularly innocent expression and a
large placid face “your pardon gentlemen ” he said in a slow drawling voice with a
pronounced transatlantic accent “but is it permitted to inspect the
scene of the crime i take it that you are both gentlemen from scotland
yard ”
“i have not that honour ” said anthony “but this gentleman is
superintendent battle of scotland yard ”
“is that so ” said the american gentleman with a great appearance of
interest “pleased to meet you sir my name is hiram p fish of new
york city ”
“what was it you wanted to see mr fish ” asked the detective the american walked gently into the room and looked with much interest
at the dark patch on the floor “i am interested in crime mr battle it is one of my hobbies i have
contributed a monograph to one of our weekly periodicals on the subject
‘degeneracy and the criminal ’”
as he spoke his eyes went gently round the room seeming to note
everything in it they rested just a shade longer on the window “the body ” said superintendent battle stating a self-evident fact “has been removed ”
“surely ” said mr fish his eyes went on to the panelled walls “some remarkable pictures in this room gentlemen a holbein two
van dycks and if i am not mistaken a velasquez i am interested
in pictures—and likewise in first editions it was to see his first
editions that lord caterham was so kind as to invite me down here ”
he sighed gently “i guess that’s all off now it would show a proper feeling i suppose for the guests to return to town immediately ”
“i’m afraid that can’t be done sir ” said superintendent battle “nobody must leave the house until after the inquest ”
“is that so and when is the inquest ”
“may be to-morrow may not be until monday we’ve got to arrange for
the autopsy and see the coroner ”
“i get you ” said mr fish “under the circumstances though it will
be a melancholy party ”
battle led the way to the door “we’d best get out of here ” he said “we’re keeping it locked still ”
he waited for the other two to pass through and then turned the key
and removed it “i opine ” said mr fish “that you are seeking for fingerprints ”
“maybe ” said the superintendent laconically “i should say to that on a night such as last night an intruder would
have left footprints on the hardwood floor ”
“none inside plenty outside ”
“mine ” explained anthony cheerfully the innocent eyes of mr fish swept over him “young man ” he said “you surprise me ”
they turned a corner and came out into the big wide hall panelled like
the council chamber in old oak and with a wide gallery above it two
other figures came into sight at the far end “aha ” said mr fish “our genial host ”
this was such a ludicrous description of lord caterham that anthony had
to turn his head away to conceal a smile “and with him ” continued the american “is a lady whose name i did not
catch last night but she is bright—she is very bright ”
with lord caterham was virginia revel anthony had been anticipating this meeting all along he had no
idea how to act he must leave it to virginia although he had full
confidence in her presence of mind he had not the slightest idea what
line she would take he was not long left in doubt “why it’s mr cade ” said virginia she held out both hands to him “so you found you could come down after all ”
“my dear mrs revel i had no idea mr cade was a friend of yours ”
said lord caterham “he’s a very old friend ” said virginia smiling at anthony with a
mischievous glint in her eye “i ran across him in london unexpectedly
yesterday and told him i was coming down here ”
anthony was quick to give her her pointer “i explained to mrs revel ” he said “that i had been forced to refuse
your kind invitation—since it had really been extended to quite a
different man and i couldn’t very well foist a perfect stranger on you
under false pretences ”
“well well my dear fellow ” said lord caterham “that’s all over and
done with now i’ll send down to the _cricketers_ for your bag ”
“it’s very kind of you lord caterham but——”
“nonsense of course you must come to chimneys horrible place the
_cricketers_—to stay in i mean ”
“of course you must come mr cade ” said virginia softly anthony realized the altered tone of his surroundings already virginia
had done much for him he was no longer an ambiguous stranger her
position was so assured and unassailable that anyone for whom she
vouched was accepted as a matter of course he thought of the pistol in
the tree at burnham beeches and smiled inwardly “i’ll send for your traps ” said lord caterham to anthony “i suppose in the circumstances we can’t have any shooting a pity but there it
is and i don’t know what the devil to do with isaacstein it’s all
very unfortunate ”
the depressed peer sighed heavily “that’s settled then ” said virginia “you can begin to be useful
right away mr cade and take me out on the lake it’s very peaceful
there and far from crime and all that sort of thing isn’t it awful for
poor lord caterham having a murder done in his house but it’s george’s
fault really this is george’s party you know ”
“ah ” said lord caterham “but i should never have listened to him ”
he assumed the air of a strong man betrayed by a single weakness “one can’t help listening to george ” said virginia “he always holds
you so that you can’t get away i’m thinking of patenting a detachable
lapel ”
“i wish you would ” chuckled her host “i’m glad you’re coming to us cade i need support ”
“i appreciate your kindness very much lord caterham ” said anthony “especially ” he added “when i’m such a suspicious character but my
staying here makes it easier for battle ”
“in what way sir ” asked the superintendent “it won’t be so difficult to keep an eye on me ” explained anthony
gently and by the momentary flicker of the superintendent’s eyelids he knew
that his shot had gone home "
Chapter 14,"14
mainly political and financial
except for that involuntary twitch of the eyelids superintendent
battle’s impassivity was unimpaired if he had been surprised at
virginia’s recognition of anthony he did not show it he and lord
caterham stood together and watched those two go out through the garden
door mr fish also watched them “nice young fellow that ” said lord caterham “vurry nice for mrs revel to meet an old friend ” murmured the
american “they have been acquainted some time presoomably ”
“seems so ” said lord caterham “but i’ve never heard her mention him
before oh by the way battle mr lomax has been asking for you he’s
in the blue morning-room ”
“very good lord caterham i’ll go there at once ”
battle found his way to the blue morning-room without difficulty he
was already familiar with the geography of the house “ah there you are battle ” said lomax he was striding impatiently up and down the carpet there was one other
person in the room a big man sitting in a chair by the fireplace he
was dressed in very correct english shooting clothes which nevertheless
sat strangely upon him he had a fat yellow face and black eyes as
impenetrable as those of a cobra there was a generous curve to the big
nose and power in the square lines of the vast jaw “come in battle ” said lomax irritably “and shut the door behind
you this is mr herman isaacstein ”
battle inclined his head respectfully he knew all about mr herman isaacstein and though the great financier
sat there silent whilst lomax strode up and down and talked he knew
who was the real power in the room “we can speak more freely now ” said lomax “before lord caterham and
colonel melrose i was anxious not to say too much you understand battle these things mustn’t get about ”
“ah ” said battle “but they always do more’s the pity ”
just for a second he saw a trace of a smile on the fat yellow face it
disappeared as suddenly as it had come “now what do you really think of this young fellow—this anthony cade ”
continued george “do you still assume him to be innocent ”
battle shrugged his shoulders very slightly “he tells a straight story part of it we shall be able to verify on the face of it it accounts for his presence here last night i
shall cable to south africa of course for information about his
antecedents ”
“then you regard him as cleared of all complicity ”
battle raised a large square hand “not so fast sir i never said that ”
“what is your own idea about the crime superintendent battle ” asked
isaacstein speaking for the first time his voice was deep and rich and had a certain compelling quality about
it it had stood him in good stead at board meetings in his younger
days “it’s rather too soon to have ideas mr isaacstein i’ve not got
beyond asking myself the first question ”
“what is that ”
“oh it’s always the same motive who benefits by the death of prince
michael we’ve got to answer that before we can get anywhere ”
“the revolutionary party of herzoslovakia——” began george superintendent battle waved him aside with something less than his
usual respect “it wasn’t the comrades of the red hand sir if you’re thinking of
them ”
“but the paper—with the scarlet hand on it ”
“put there to suggest the obvious solution ”
george’s dignity was a little ruffled “really battle i don’t see how you can be so sure of that ”
“bless you mr lomax we know all about the comrades of the red hand we’ve had our eye on them ever since prince michael landed in england that sort of thing is the elementary work of the department they’d
never be allowed to get within a mile of him ”
“i agree with superintendent battle ” said isaacstein “we must look
elsewhere ”
“you see sir ” said battle encouraged by his support “we do know a
little about the case if we don’t know who gains by his death we do
know who loses by it ”
“meaning ” said isaacstein his black eyes were bent upon the detective more than ever he
reminded battle of a hooded cobra “you and mr lomax not to mention the loyalist party of herzoslovakia if you’ll pardon the expression sir you’re in the soup ”
“really battle ” interposed george shocked to the core “go on battle ” said isaacstein “in the soup describes the situation
very accurately you’re an intelligent man ”
“you’ve got to have a king you’ve lost your king—like that ” he
snapped his large fingers “you’ve got to find another in a hurry and
that’s not an easy job no i don’t want to know the details of your
scheme the bare outline is enough for me but i take it it’s a big
deal ”
isaacstein bent his head slowly “it’s a very big deal ”
“that brings me to my second question who is the next heir to the
throne of herzoslovakia ”
isaacstein looked across at lomax the latter answered the question with a certain reluctance and a good deal of hesitation:
“that would be—i should say—yes in all probability prince nicholas
would be the next heir ”
“ah ” said battle “and who is prince nicholas ”
“a first cousin of prince michael’s ”
“ah ” said battle “i should like to hear all about prince nicholas especially where he is at present ”
“nothing much is known of him ” said lomax “as a young man he was
most peculiar in his ideas consorted with socialists and republicans and acted in a way highly unbecoming to his position he was sent down
from oxford i believe for some wild escapade there was a rumour
of his death two years later in the congo but it was only a rumour he turned up a few months ago when news of the royalist reaction got
about ”
“indeed ” said battle “where did he turn up ”
“in america ”
“america ”
battle turned to isaacstein with one laconic word:
“oil ”
the financier nodded “he represented that if the herzoslovakians chose a king they would
prefer him to prince michael as being more in sympathy with modern
enlightened ideas and he drew attention to his early democratic views
and his sympathy with republican ideals in return for financial
support he was prepared to grant concessions to a certain group of
american financiers ”
superintendent battle so far forgot his habitual impassivity as to give
vent to a prolonged whistle “so that is it ” he muttered “in the meantime the loyalist party
supported prince michael and you felt sure you’d come out on top and
then this happens ”
“you surely don’t think——” began george “it was a big deal ” said battle “mr isaacstein says so and i
should say that what he calls a big deal _is_ a big deal ”
“there are always unscrupulous tools to be got hold of ” said
isaacstein quietly “for the moment wall street wins but they’ve not
done with me yet find out who killed prince michael superintendent
battle if you want to do your country a service ”
“one thing strikes me as highly suspicious ” put in george “why did
the equerry captain andrassy not come down with the prince yesterday ”
“i’ve inquired into that ” said battle “it’s perfectly simple he
stayed in town to make arrangements with a certain lady on behalf of
prince michael for next week-end the baron rather frowned on such
things thinking them injudicious at the present stage of affairs so
his highness had to go about them in a hole and corner manner he was if i may say so inclined to be a rather—er—dissipated young man ”
“i’m afraid so ” said george ponderously “yes i’m afraid so ”
“there’s one other point we ought to take into account i think ” said
battle speaking with a certain amount of hesitation “king victor’s
supposed to be in england ”
“king victor ”
lomax frowned in an effort at recollection “notorious french crook sir we’ve had a warning from the sûreté in
paris ”
“of course ” said george “i remember now jewel thief isn’t he why that’s the man——”
he broke off abruptly isaacstein who had been frowning abstractedly
at the fireplace looked up just too late to catch the warning glance
telegraphed from superintendent battle to the other but being a man
sensitive to vibrations in the atmosphere he was conscious of a sense
of strain “you don’t want me any longer do you lomax ” he inquired “no thank you my dear fellow ”
“would it upset your plans if i returned to london superintendent
battle ”
“i’m afraid so sir ” said the superintendent civilly “you see if you
go there will be others who’ll want to go also and that would never
do ”
“quite so ”
the great financier left the room closing the door behind him “splendid fellow isaacstein ” murmured george lomax perfunctorily “very powerful personality ” agreed superintendent battle george began to pace up and down again “what you say disturbs me greatly ” he began “king victor i thought
he was in prison ”
“came out a few months ago french police meant to keep on his heels but he managed to give them the slip straight away he would too one
of the coolest customers that ever lived for some reason or other they believe he’s in england and have notified us to that effect ”
“but what should he be doing in england ”
“that’s for you to say sir ” said battle significantly “you mean—— you think—— you know the story of course—ah yes i can see you do i was not in office of course at the time but i
heard the whole story from the late lord caterham an unparalleled
catastrophe ”
“the koh-i-noor ” said battle reflectively “hush battle ” george glanced suspiciously round him “i beg of you mention no names much better not if you must speak of it call it the
k ”
the superintendent looked wooden again “you don’t connect king victor with this crime do you battle ”
“it’s just a possibility that’s all if you’ll cast your mind back sir you’ll remember that there were four places where a—er—certain
royal visitor might have concealed the jewel chimneys was one of them king victor was arrested in paris three days after the—disappearance if i may call it that of the k it was always hoped that he would some
day lead us to the jewel ”
“but chimneys has been ransacked and overhauled a dozen times ”
“yes ” said battle sapiently “but it’s never much good looking when
you don’t know where to look only suppose now that this king victor
came here to look for the thing was surprised by prince michael and
shot him ”
“it’s possible ” said george “a most likely solution of the crime ”
“i wouldn’t go as far as that it’s possible but not much more ”
“why is that ”
“because king victor has never been known to take a life ” said battle
seriously “oh but a man like that—a dangerous criminal——”
but battle shook his head in a dissatisfied manner “criminals always act true to type mr lomax it’s surprising all the
same——”
“yes ”
“i’d rather like to question the prince’s servant i’ve left him
purposely to the last we’ll have him in here sir if you don’t mind ”
george signified his assent the superintendent rang the bell tredwell
answered it and departed with his instructions he returned shortly accompanied by a tall fair man with high
cheek-bones and very deep-set blue eyes and an impassivity of
countenance which almost rivalled battle’s “boris anchoukoff ”
“yes ”
“you were valet to prince michael ”
“i was his highness’s valet yes ”
the man spoke good english though with a markedly harsh foreign accent “you know that your master was murdered last night ”
a deep snarl like the snarl of a wild beast was the man’s only
answer it alarmed george who withdrew prudently towards the window “when did you see your master last ”
“his highness retired to bed at half-past ten i slept as always in the ante-room next to him he must have gone down to the room
downstairs by the other door the door that gave on to the corridor i did not hear him go it may be that i was drugged i have been an
unfaithful servant i slept while my master woke i am accursed ”
george gazed at him fascinated “you loved your master eh ” said battle watching the man closely boris’s features contracted painfully he swallowed twice then his
voice came harsh with emotion “i say this to you english policeman i would have died for him and
since he is dead and i still live my eyes shall not know sleep or
my heart rest until i have avenged him like a dog will i nose out
his murderer and when i have discovered him—— ah ” his eyes lit up suddenly he drew an immense knife from beneath his coat and brandished
it aloft “not all at once will i kill him—oh no —first i will slit
his nose and cut off his ears and put out his eyes and then—then into his black heart i will thrust this knife ”
swiftly he replaced the knife and turning left the room george
lomax his eyes always protuberant but now goggling almost out of his
head stared at the closed door “pure bred herzoslovakian of course ” he muttered “most uncivilized
people a race of brigands ”
superintendent battle rose alertly to his feet “either that man’s sincere ” he remarked “or he’s the best bluffer
i’ve ever seen and if it’s the former god help prince michael’s
murderer when that human bloodhound gets hold of him ”"
Chapter 15,"15
the french stranger
virginia and anthony walked side by side down the path which led to the
lake for some minutes after leaving the house they were silent it was
virginia who broke the silence at last with a little laugh “oh dear ” she said “isn’t it dreadful here i am so bursting with
the things i want to tell you and the things i want to know that
i simply don’t know where to begin first of all”—she lowered her
voice—“_what have you done with the body _ how awful it sounds doesn’t it i never dreamt that i should be so steeped in crime ”
“i suppose it’s quite a novel sensation for you ” agreed anthony “but not for you ”
“well i’ve never disposed of a corpse before certainly ”
“tell me about it ”
briefly and succinctly anthony ran over the steps he had taken on the
previous night virginia listened attentively “i think you were very clever ” she said approvingly when he had
finished “i can pick up the trunk again when i go back to paddington the only difficulty that might arise is if you had to give an account
of where you were yesterday evening ”
“i can’t see that that can arise the body can’t have been found until
late last night—or possibly this morning otherwise there would have
been something about it in this morning’s papers and whatever you may
imagine from reading detective stories doctors aren’t such magicians
that they can tell you exactly how many hours a man has been dead the
exact time of his death will be pretty vague an alibi for last night
would be far more to the point ”
“i know lord caterham was telling me all about it but the scotland
yard man is quite convinced of your innocence now isn’t he ”
anthony did not reply at once “he doesn’t look particularly astute ” continued virginia “i don’t know about that ” said anthony slowly “i’ve an impression
that there are no flies on superintendent battle he appears to be
convinced of my innocence—but i’m not so sure he’s stumped at present
by my apparent lack of motive ”
“apparent ” cried virginia “but what possible reason could you have
for murdering an unknown foreign count ”
anthony darted a sharp glance at her “you were at one time or other in herzoslovakia weren’t you ” he asked “yes i was there with my husband for two years at the embassy ”
“that was just before the assassination of the king and queen did you
ever run across prince michael obolovitch ”
“michael of course i did horrid little wretch he suggested i
remember that i should marry him morganatically ”
“did he really and what did he suggest you should do about your
existing husband ”
“oh he had a sort of david and uriah scheme all made out ”
“and how did you respond to this amiable offer ”
“well ” said virginia “unfortunately one had to be diplomatic so poor
little michael didn’t get it as straight from the shoulder as he might
have done but he retired hurt all the same why all this interest
about michael ”
“something i’m getting at in my own blundering fashion i take it that
you didn’t meet the murdered man ”
“no to put it like a book he ‘retired to his own apartments
immediately on arrival ’”
“and of course you haven’t seen the body ”
virginia eyeing him with a good deal of interest shook her head “could you get to see it do you think ”
“by means of influence in high places—meaning lord caterham—i dare
say i could why is it an order ”
“good lord no ” said anthony horrified “have i been as dictatorial
as all that no it’s simply this count stanislaus was the incognito
of prince michael of herzoslovakia ”
virginia’s eyes opened very wide “i see ” suddenly her face broke into its fascinating one-sided smile “i hope you don’t suggest that michael went to his rooms simply to
avoid seeing me ”
“something of the kind ” admitted anthony “you see if i’m right in
my idea that some one wanted to prevent your coming to chimneys the
reason seems to lie in your knowing herzoslovakia do you realize that
you’re the only person here who knew prince michael by sight ”
“do you mean that this man who was murdered was an impostor ” asked
virginia abruptly “that is the possibility that crossed my mind if you can get lord
caterham to show you the body we can clear up that point at once ”
“he was shot at 11 45 ” said virginia thoughtfully “the time mentioned
on that scrap of paper the whole thing’s horribly mysterious ”
“that reminds me is that your window up there the second from the end
over the council chamber ”
“no my room is in the elizabethan wing the other side why ”
“simply because as i walked away last night after thinking i heard a
shot the light went up in that room ”
“how curious i don’t know who has that room but i can find out by
asking bundle perhaps they heard the shot ”
“if so they haven’t come forward to say so i understood from battle
that nobody in the house heard the shot fired it’s the only clue of
any kind that i’ve got and i dare say it’s a pretty rotten one but i
mean to follow it up for what it’s worth ”
“it’s curious certainly ” said virginia thoughtfully they had arrived at the boat-house by the lake and had been leaning
against it as they talked “and now for the whole story ” said anthony “we’ll paddle gently about
on the lake secure from the prying ears of scotland yard american
visitors and curious house-maids ”
“i’ve heard something from lord caterham ” said virginia “but not
nearly enough to begin with which are you really anthony cade or
jimmy mcgrath ”
for the second time that morning anthony unfolded the history of the
last six weeks of his life—with this difference that the account given
to virginia needed no editing he finished up with his own astonished
recognition of “mr holmes ”
“by the way mrs revel ” he ended “i’ve never thanked you for
imperilling your immortal soul by saying that i was an old friend of
yours ”
“of course you’re an old friend ” cried virginia “you don’t suppose
i’d cumber you with a corpse and then pretend you were a mere
acquaintance next time i met you no indeed ”
she paused “do you know one thing that strikes me about all this ” she went on “that there’s some extra mystery about those memoirs that we haven’t
fathomed yet ”
“i think you’re right ” agreed anthony “there’s one thing i’d like you
to tell me ” he continued “what’s that ”
“why did you seem so surprised when i mentioned the name of jimmy
mcgrath to you yesterday at pont street had you heard it before ”
“i had sherlock holmes george—my cousin george lomax you
know—came to see me the other day and suggested a lot of frightfully
silly things his idea was that i should come down here and make
myself agreeable to this man mcgrath and delilah the memoirs out of
him somehow he didn’t put it like that of course he talked a lot of
nonsense about english gentlewomen and things like that but his real
meaning was never obscure for a moment it was just the sort of rotten
thing poor old george would think of and then i wanted to know too
much and he tried to put me off with lies that wouldn’t have deceived
a child of two ”
“well his plan seems to have succeeded anyhow ” observed anthony “here am i the james mcgrath he had in mind and here are you being
agreeable to me ”
“but alas for poor old george no memoirs now i’ve got a question
for you when i said i hadn’t written those letters you said you knew
i hadn’t—you couldn’t know any such thing ”
“oh yes i could ” said anthony smiling “i’ve got a good working
knowledge of psychology ”
“you mean your belief in the sterling worth of my moral character was
such that——”
but anthony was shaking his head vigorously “not at all i don’t know anything about your moral character you
might have a lover and you might write to him but you’d never lie
down to be blackmailed the virginia revel of those letters was scared
stiff you’d have fought ”
“i wonder who the real virginia revel is—where she is i mean it
makes me feel as though i had a double somewhere ”
anthony lit a cigarette “you know that one of the letters was written from chimneys ” he asked
at last “what ” virginia was clearly startled “when was it written ”
“it wasn’t dated but it’s odd isn’t it ”
“i’m perfectly certain no other virginia revel has ever stayed at
chimneys bundle or lord caterham would have said something about the
coincidence of the name if she had ”
“yes it’s rather queer do you know mrs revel i am beginning to
disbelieve profoundly in this other virginia revel ”
“she’s very elusive ” agreed virginia “extraordinarily elusive i am beginning to think that the person who
wrote those letters deliberately used your name ”
“but why ” cried virginia “why should they do such a thing ”
“ah that’s just the question there’s the devil of a lot to find out
about everything ”
“who do you really think killed michael ” asked virginia suddenly “the
comrades of the red hand ”
“i suppose they might have done so ” said anthony in a dissatisfied
voice “pointless killing would be rather characteristic of them ”
“let’s get to work ” said virginia “i see lord caterham and bundle
strolling together the first thing to do is to find out definitely
whether the dead man is michael or not ”
anthony paddled to shore and a few moments later they had joined lord
caterham and his daughter “lunch is late ” said his lordship in a depressed voice “battle has
insulted the cook i expect ”
“this is a friend of mine bundle ” said virginia “be nice to him ”
bundle looked earnestly at anthony for some minutes and then addressed
a remark to virginia as though he had not been there “where do you pick up these nice-looking men virginia ‘how do you do
it ’ says she enviously ”
“you can have him ” said virginia generously “i want lord caterham ”
she smiled upon the flattered peer slipped her hand through his arm
and they moved off together “do you talk ” asked bundle “or are you just strong and silent ”
“talk ” said anthony “i babble i murmur i gurgle—like the running
brook you know sometimes i even ask questions ”
“as for instance ”
“who occupies the second room on the left from the end ”
he pointed to it as he spoke “what an extraordinary question ” said bundle “you intrigue me
greatly let me see—yes—that’s mademoiselle brun’s room the french
governess she endeavours to keep my young sisters in order dulcie and
daisy—like the song you know i dare say they’d have called the next
one dorothy may but mother got tired of having nothing but girls and
died thought some one else could take on the job of providing an heir ”
“mademoiselle brun ” said anthony thoughtfully “how long has she been
with you ”
“two months she came to us when we were in scotland ”
“ha ” said anthony “i smell a rat ”
“i wish i could smell some lunch ” said bundle “do i ask the scotland
yard man to have lunch with us mr cade you’re a man of the world you know about the etiquette of such things we’ve never had a murder
in the house before exciting isn’t it i’m sorry your character
was so completely cleared this morning i’ve always wanted to meet a
murderer and see for myself if they’re as genial and charming as the
sunday papers always say they are god what’s that ”
“what” seemed to be a taxi approaching the house its two occupants
were a tall man with a bald head and a black beard and a smaller
and younger man with a black moustache anthony recognized the
former and guessed that it was he—rather than the vehicle which
contained him—that had wrung the exclamation of astonishment from his
companion’s lips “unless i much mistake ” he remarked “that is my old friend baron
lollipop ”
“baron what ”
“i call him lollipop for convenience the pronouncing of his own name
tends to harden the arteries ”
“it nearly wrecked the telephone this morning ” remarked bundle “so
that’s the baron is it i foresee he’ll be turned on to me this
afternoon—and i’ve had isaacstein all the morning let george do his
own dirty work say i and to hell with politics excuse me leaving
you mr cade but i must stand by poor old father ”
bundle retreated rapidly to the house anthony stood looking after her for a minute or two and thoughtfully
lighted a cigarette as he did so his ear was caught by a stealthy
sound quite near him he was standing by the boat-house and the sound
seemed to come from just round the corner the mental picture conveyed
to him was that of a man vainly trying to stifle a sudden sneeze “now i wonder—i very much wonder who’s behind the boat-house ” said
anthony to himself “we’d better see i think ”
suiting the action to the word he threw away the match he had just
blown out and ran lightly and noiselessly round the corner of the
boat-house he came upon a man who had evidently been kneeling on the ground and
was just struggling to rise to his feet he was tall wore a light
coloured overcoat and glasses and for the rest had a short pointed
black beard and a slightly foppish manner he was between thirty and
forty years of age and altogether of a most respectable appearance “what are you doing here ” asked anthony he was pretty certain that the man was not one of lord caterham’s
guests “i ask your pardon ” said the stranger with a marked foreign accent
and what was meant to be an engaging smile “it is that i wish to
return to the _jolly crickets_ and i have lost my way would monsieur
be so good as to direct me ”
“certainly ” said anthony “but you don’t go there by water you know ”
“eh ” said the stranger with the air of one at a loss “i said ” repeated anthony with a meaning glance at the boat-house “that you won’t get there by water there’s a right of way across the
park—some distance away but all this is the private part you’re
trespassing ”
“i am most sorry ” said the stranger “i lost my direction entirely i
thought i would come up here and inquire ”
anthony refrained from pointing out that kneeling behind a boat-house
was a somewhat peculiar manner of prosecuting inquiries he took the
stranger kindly by the arm “you go this way ” he said “right round the lake and straight on—you
can’t miss the path when you get on it turn to the left and it will
lead you to the village you’re staying at the _cricketers_ i suppose ”
“i am monsieur since this morning many thanks for your kindness in
directing me ”
“don’t mention it ” said anthony “i hope you haven’t caught cold ”
“eh ” said the stranger “from kneeling on the damp ground i mean ” explained anthony “i
fancied i heard you sneezing ”
“i may have sneezed ” admitted the other “quite so ” said anthony “but you shouldn’t suppress a sneeze you
know one of the most eminent doctors said so only the other day it’s frightfully dangerous i don’t remember exactly what it does to
you—whether it’s an inhibition or whether it hardens your arteries but you must never do it good morning ”
“good morning and thank you monsieur for setting me on the right
road ”
“second suspicious stranger from village inn ” murmured anthony to
himself as he watched the other’s retreating form “and one that i
can’t quite place either appearance that of a french commercial
traveller i don’t quite see him as a comrade of the red hand does he
represent yet a third party in the harassed state of herzoslovakia the french governess has the second window from the end a mysterious
frenchman is found slinking round the grounds listening to
conversations that are not meant for his ears i’ll bet my hat there’s
something in it ”
musing thus anthony retraced his steps to the house on the terrace
he encountered lord caterham looking suitably depressed and two new
arrivals he brightened a little at the sight of anthony “ah there you are ” he remarked “let me introduce you to
baron—er—er—and captain andrassy mr anthony cade ”
the baron stared at anthony with growing suspicion “mr cade ” he said stiffly “i think not ”
“a word alone with you baron ” said anthony “i can explain
everything ”
the baron bowed and the two men walked down the terrace together “baron ” said anthony “i must throw myself upon your mercy i have so
far strained the honour of an english gentleman as to travel to this
country under an assumed name i represented myself to you as mr james
mcgrath—but you must see for yourself that the deception involved
was infinitesimal you are doubtless acquainted with the works of
shakespeare and his remarks about the unimportance of the nomenclature
of roses this case is the same the man you wanted to see was the man
in possession of the memoirs i was that man as you know only too
well i am no longer in possession of them a neat trick baron a very
neat trick who thought of it you or your principal ”
“his highness’s own idea it was and for anyone but him to carry it out
he would not permit ”
“he did it jolly well ” said anthony with approval “i never took him
for anything but an englishman ”
“the education of an english gentleman did the prince receive ”
explained the baron “the custom of herzoslovakia it is ”
“no professional could have pinched those papers better ” said anthony “may i ask without indiscretion what has become of them ”
“between gentlemen ” began the baron “you are too kind baron ” murmured anthony “i’ve never been called a
gentleman so often as i have in the last forty-eight hours ”
“i to you say this—i believe them to be burnt ”
“you believe but you don’t know eh is that it ”
“his highness in his own keeping retained them his purpose it was to
read them and then by the fire to destroy them ”
“i see ” said anthony “all the same they are not the kind of light
literature you’d skim through in half an hour ”
“among the effects of my martyred master they have not discovered been it is clear therefore that burnt they are ”
“h’m ” said anthony “i wonder ”
he was silent for a minute or two and then went on “i have asked you these questions baron because as you may have
heard i myself have been implicated in the crime i must clear myself
absolutely so that no suspicion attaches to me ”
“undoubtedly ” said the baron “your honour demands it ”
“exactly ” said anthony “you put these things so well i haven’t got
the knack of it to continue i can only clear myself by discovering
the real murderer and to do that i must have all the facts this
question of the memoirs is very important it seems to me possible that
to gain possession of them might be the motive of the crime tell me baron is that a very far-fetched idea ”
the baron hesitated for a moment or two “you yourself the memoirs have read ” he asked cautiously at length “i think i am answered ” said anthony smiling “now baron there’s
just one thing more i should like to give you fair warning that it
is still my intention to deliver that manuscript to the publishers on
wednesday next the 13th of october ”
the baron stared at him “but you have no longer got it ”
“on wednesday next i said to-day is friday that gives me five days
to get hold of it again ”
“but if it is burnt ”
“i don’t think it is burnt i have good reasons for not believing so ”
as he spoke they turned the corner of the terrace a massive figure was
advancing towards them anthony who had not yet seen the great mr herman isaacstein looked at him with considerable interest “ah baron ” said isaacstein waving the big black cigar he was
smoking “this is a bad business—a very bad business ”
“my good friend mr isaacstein it is indeed ” cried the baron “all
our noble edifice in ruins is ”
anthony tactfully left the two gentlemen to their lamentations and
retraced his steps along the terrace suddenly he came to a halt a thin spiral of smoke was rising into the
air apparently from the very centre of the yew hedge “it must be hollow in the middle ” reflected anthony “i’ve heard of
such things before ”
he looked swiftly to right and left of him lord caterham was at the
farther end of the terrace with captain andrassy their backs were
towards him anthony bent down and wriggled his way through the massive
yew he had been quite right in his supposition the yew hedge was really
not one but two a narrow passage divided them the entrance to this
was about half-way up on the side of the house there was no mystery
about it but no one seeing the yew hedge from the front would have
guessed at the probability anthony looked down the narrow vista about half-way down a man was
reclining in a basket chair a half-smoked cigar rested on the arm of
the chair and the gentleman himself appeared to be asleep “h’m ” said anthony to himself “evidently mr hiram fish prefers
sitting in the shade ”"
Chapter 16,"16
tea in the schoolroom
anthony regained the terrace with the feeling uppermost in his mind
that the only safe place for private conversations was the middle of
the lake the resonant boom of a gong sounded from the house and tredwell
appeared in a stately fashion from a side door “luncheon is served my lord ”
“ah ” said lord caterham brisking up a little “lunch ”
at that moment two children burst out of the house they were
high-spirited young women of twelve and ten and though their names
might be dulcie and daisy as bundle had affirmed they appeared to be
more generally known as guggle and winkle they executed a kind of war
dance interspersed with shrill whoops till bundle emerged and quelled
them “where’s mademoiselle ” she demanded “she’s got the _migraine_ the _migraine_ the _migraine_ ” chanted
winkle “hurrah ” said guggle joining in lord caterham had succeeded in shepherding most of his guests into the
house now he laid a restraining hand on anthony’s arm “come to my study ” he breathed “i’ve got something rather special
there ”
slinking down the hall far more like a thief than like the master of
the house lord caterham gained the shelter of his sanctum here he
unlocked a cupboard and produced various bottles “talking to foreigners always makes me so thirsty ” he explained
apologetically “i don’t know why it is ”
there was a knock on the door and virginia popped her head round the
corner of it “got a special cocktail for me ” she demanded “of course ” said lord caterham hospitably “come in ”
the next few minutes were taken up with serious rites “i needed that ” said lord caterham with a sigh as he replaced his
glass on the table “as i said just now i find talking to foreigners
particularly fatiguing i think it’s because they’re so polite come
along let’s have some lunch ”
he led the way to the dining-room virginia put her hand on anthony’s
arm and drew him back a little “i’ve done my good deed for the day ” she whispered “i got lord
caterham to take me to see the body ”
“well ” demanded anthony eagerly one theory of his was to be proved or disproved virginia was shaking her head “you were wrong ” she whispered “it’s prince michael all right ”
“oh ” anthony was deeply chagrined “and mademoiselle has the _migraine_ ” he added aloud in a
dissatisfied tone “what has that got to do with it ”
“probably nothing but i wanted to see her you see i’ve found out
that mademoiselle has the second room from the end—the one where i saw
the light last night ”
“that’s interesting ”
“probably there’s nothing in it all the same i mean to see
mademoiselle before the day is out ”
lunch was somewhat of an ordeal even the cheerful impartiality of
bundle failed to reconcile the heterogeneous assembly the baron and
andrassy were correct formal full of etiquette and had the air of
attending a meal in a mausoleum lord caterham was lethargic and
depressed bill eversleigh stared longingly at virginia george very
mindful of the trying position in which he found himself conversed
weightily with the baron and mr isaacstein guggle and winkle completely beside themselves with joy of having a murder in the house had to be continually checked and kept under whilst mr hiram fish
slowly masticated his food and drawled out dry remarks in his own
peculiar idiom superintendent battle had considerately vanished and
nobody knew what had become of him “thank god that’s over ” murmured bundle to anthony as they left the
table “and george is taking the foreign contingent over to the abbey
this afternoon to discuss state secrets ”
“that will possibly relieve the atmosphere ” agreed anthony “i don’t mind the american so much ” continued bundle “he and father
can talk first editions together quite happily in some secluded spot mr fish”—as the object of their conversation drew near—“i’m planning
a peaceful afternoon for you ”
the american bowed “that’s too kind of you lady eileen ”
“mr fish ” said anthony “had quite a peaceful morning ”
mr fish shot a quick glance at him “ah sir you observed me then in my seclooded retreat there are
moments sir when far from the madding crowd is the only motto for a
man of quiet tastes ”
bundle had drifted on and the american and anthony were left together the former dropped his voice a little “i opine ” he said “that there is considerable mystery about this
little dust up ”
“any amount of it ” said anthony “that guy with the bald head was perhaps a family connection ”
“something of the kind ”
“these central european nations beat the band ” declared mr fish “it’s kind of being rumoured around that the deceased gentleman was a
royal highness is that so do you know ”
“he was staying here as count stanislaus ” replied anthony evasively to this mr fish offered no further rejoinder than the somewhat cryptic:
“oh boy ”
after which he relapsed into silence for some moments “this police captain of yours ” he observed at last “battle or
whatever his name is is he the goods all right ”
“scotland yard thinks so ” replied anthony dryly “he seems kind of hide-bound to me ” remarked mr fish “no hustle to
him this big idea of his letting no one leave the house what is
there to it ”
he darted a very sharp look at anthony as he spoke “everyone’s got to attend the inquest to-morrow morning you see ”
“that’s the idea is it no more to it than that no question of lord
caterham’s guests being suspected ”
“my dear mr fish ”
“i was getting a mite uneasy—being a stranger in this country but of
course it was an outside job—i remember now window found unfastened wasn’t it ”
“it was ” said anthony looking straight in front of him mr fish sighed after a minute or two he said in a plaintive tone:
“young man do you know how they get the water out of a mine ”
“how ”
“by pumping—but its almighty hard work i observe the figure of my
genial host detaching itself from the group over yonder i must join
him ”
mr fish walked gently away and bundle drifted back again “funny fish isn’t he ” she remarked “he is ”
“it’s no good looking at virginia ” said bundle sharply “i wasn’t ”
“you were i don’t know how she does it it isn’t what she says i
don’t even believe it’s what she looks but oh boy she gets there
every time anyway she’s on duty elsewhere for the time she told
me to be nice to you and i’m going to be nice to you—by force if
necessary ”
“no force required ” anthony assured her “but if it’s all the same to
you i’d rather you were nice to me on the water in a boat ”
“it’s not a bad idea ” said bundle meditatively they strolled down to the lake together “there’s just one question i’d like to ask you ” said anthony as
he paddled gently out from the shore “before we turn to really
interesting topics business before pleasure ”
“whose bedroom do you want to know about now ” asked bundle with weary
patience “nobody’s bedroom for the moment but i would like to know where you
got your french governess from ”
“the man’s bewitched ” said bundle “i got her from an agency and i
pay her a hundred pounds a year and her christian name is genevieve anything more you want to know ”
“we’ll assume the agency ” said anthony “what about her references ”
“oh glowing she’d lived for ten years with the countess of what not ”
“what not being—— ”
“the comtesses de breteuil chateau de breteuil dinard ”
“you didn’t actually see the comtesse yourself it was all done by
letter ”
“exactly ”
“h’m ” said anthony “you intrigue me ” said bundle “you intrigue me enormously is it love
or crime ”
“probably sheer idiocy on my part let’s forget it ”
“‘let’s forget it ’ said he negligently having extracted all the
information he wants mr cade who do you suspect i rather suspect
virginia as being the most unlikely person or possibly bill ”
“what about you ”
“member of the aristocracy joins in secret the comrades of the red
hand it would create a sensation all right ”
anthony laughed he liked bundle though he was a little afraid of the
shrewd penetration of her sharp grey eyes “you must be proud of all this ” he said suddenly waving his hand
towards the great house in the distance bundle screwed up her eyes and tilted her head on one side “yes—it means something i suppose but one’s too used to it anyway we’re not here very much—too deadly dull we’ve been at cowes and
deauville all the summer after town and then up to scotland chimneys
has been swathed in dust sheets for about five months once a week
they take the dust sheets off and chars-à-bancs full of tourists come
and gape and listen to tredwell ‘on your right is the portrait of
the fourth marchioness of caterham painted by sir joshua reynolds ’
etc and ed or bert the humorist of the party nudges his girl and
says ‘eh gladys they’ve got two pennyworth of pictures here right
enough ’ and then they go and look at more pictures and yawn and
shuffle their feet and wish it was time to go home ”
“yet history has been made here once or twice by all accounts ”
“you’ve been listening to george ” said bundle sharply “that’s the
kind of thing he’s always saying ”
but anthony had raised himself on his elbow and was staring at the
shore “is that a third suspicious stranger i see standing disconsolately by
the boat-house or is it one of the house party ”
bundle lifted her head from the scarlet cushion “it’s bill ” she said “he seems to be looking for something ”
“he’s probably looking for me ” said bundle without enthusiasm “shall we row quickly in the opposite direction ”
“that’s quite the right answer but it should be delivered with more
enthusiasm ”
“i shall row with double vigour after that rebuke ”
“not at all ” said bundle “i have my pride row me to where that young
ass is waiting somebody’s got to look after him i suppose virginia
must have given him the slip one of these days inconceivable as it
seems i might want to marry george so i might as well practise being
‘one of our well known political hostesses ’”
anthony pulled obediently towards the shore “and what’s to become of me i should like to know ” he complained “i refuse to be the unwanted third is that the children i see in the
distance ”
“yes be careful or they’ll rope you in ”
“i’m rather fond of children ” said anthony “i might teach them some
nice quiet intellectual game ”
“well don’t say i didn’t warn you ”
having relinquished bundle to the care of her gallant captain anthony
strolled off to where various shrill cries disturbed the peace of the
afternoon he was received with acclamation “are you any good at playing red indians ” asked guggle sternly “rather ” said anthony “you should hear the noise i make when i’m
being scalped like this ” he illustrated “not so bad ” said winkle grudgingly “now do the scalper’s yell ”
anthony obliged with a blood-curdling noise in another minute the game
of red indians was in full swing about an hour later anthony wiped his forehead and ventured to
inquire after mademoiselle’s _migraine_ he was pleased to hear that
that lady had entirely recovered so popular had he become that he was
urgently invited to come and have tea in the schoolroom “and then you can tell us about the man you saw hung ” urged guggle “did you say you’d got a bit of the rope with you ” asked winkle “it’s in my suit-case ” said anthony solemnly “you shall each have a
piece of it ”
winkle immediately let out a wild indian yell of satisfaction “we’ll have to go and get washed i suppose ” said guggle gloomily “you will come to tea won’t you you won’t forget ”
anthony swore solemnly that nothing should prevent his keeping the
engagement satisfied the youthful pair beat a retreat towards the
house anthony stood for a minute looking after them and as he did
so he became aware of a man leaving the other side of a little copse
of trees and hurrying away across the park he felt almost sure that it
was the same black-bearded stranger he had encountered that morning whilst he was hesitating whether to go after him or not the trees just
ahead of him were parted and mr hiram fish stepped out into the open he stared slightly when he saw anthony “a peaceful afternoon mr fish ” inquired the latter “i thank you yes ”
mr fish did not look as peaceful as usual however his face was
flushed and he was breathing hard as though he had been running he
drew out his watch and consulted it “i guess ” he said softly “it’s just about time for your british
institution of afternoon tea ”
closing his watch with a snap mr fish ambled gently away in the
direction of the house anthony stood in a brown study and awoke with a start to the fact that
superintendent battle was standing beside him not the faintest sound
had heralded his approach and he seemed literally to have materialized
from space “where did you spring from ” asked anthony irritably with a slight jerk of his head battle indicated the little copse of
trees behind them “it seems a popular spot this afternoon ” remarked anthony “you were very lost in thought mr cade ”
“i was indeed do you know what i was doing battle i was trying to
put two and one and five and three together so as to make four and it
can’t be done battle it simply can’t be done ”
“there’s difficulties that way ” agreed the detective “but you’re just the man i wanted to see battle i want to go away can it be done ”
true to his creed superintendent battle showed neither emotion nor
surprise his reply was easy and matter of fact “that depends sir as to where you want to go ”
“i’ll tell you exactly battle i’ll lay my cards upon the table i want to go to dinard to the chateau of madame la comtesse de
breteuil can it be done ”
“when do you want to go mr cade ”
“say to-morrow after the inquest i could be back here by sunday
evening ”
“i see ” said the superintendent with peculiar solidity “well what about it ”
“i’ve no objection provided you go where you say you’re going and
come straight back here ”
“you’re a man in a thousand battle either you have taken an
extraordinary fancy to me or else you’re extraordinarily deep which is
it ”
superintendent battle smiled a little but did not answer “well well ” said anthony “i expect you’ll take your precautions discreet minions of the law will follow my suspicious footsteps so be
it but i do wish i knew what it was all about ”
“i don’t get you mr cade ”
“the memoirs—what all the fuss is about were they only memoirs or
have you got something up your sleeve ”
battle smiled again “take it like this i’m doing you a favour because you’ve made a
favourable impression on me mr cade i’d like you to work in with
me over this case the amateur and the professional they go well
together the one has the intimacy so to speak and the other the
experience ”
“well ” said anthony slowly “i don’t mind admitting that i’ve always
wanted to try my hand at unravelling a murder mystery ”
“any ideas about the case at all mr cade ”
“plenty of them ” said anthony “but they’re mostly questions ”
“as for instance ”
“who steps into the murdered michael’s shoes it seems to me that that
is important ”
a rather wry smile came over superintendent battle’s face “i wondered if you’d think of that sir prince nicolas obolovitch is
the next heir—first cousin of this gentleman ”
“and where is he at the present moment ” asked anthony turning away
to light a cigarette “don’t tell me you don’t know battle because i
shan’t believe you ”
“we’ve reason to believe that he’s in the united states he was until
quite lately at all events raising money on his expectations ”
anthony gave vent to a surprised whistle “i get you ” said anthony “michael was backed by england nicholas
by america in both countries a group of financiers are anxious to
obtain the oil concessions the loyalist party adopted michael as their
candidate—now they’ll have to look elsewhere gnashing of teeth on the
part of isaacstein and co and mr george lomax rejoicings in wall
street am i right ”
“you’re not far off ” said superintendent battle “h’m ” said anthony “i almost dare swear that i know what you were
doing in that copse ”
the detective smiled but made no reply “international politics are very fascinating ” said anthony “but i
fear i must leave you i have an appointment in the schoolroom ”
he strode briskly away towards the house inquiries of the dignified
tredwell showed him the way to the schoolroom he tapped on the door
and entered to be greeted by squeals of joy guggle and winkle immediately rushed at him and bore him in triumph to
be introduced to mademoiselle for the first time anthony felt a qualm mademoiselle brun was a
small middle-aged woman with a sallow face pepper and salt hair and
a budding moustache as the notorious foreign adventuress she did not fit into the picture
at all “i believe ” said anthony to himself “i’m making the most utter fool
of myself never mind i must go through with it now ”
he was extremely pleasant to mademoiselle and she on her part was evidently delighted to have a good-looking young man invade her
schoolroom the meal was a great success but that evening alone in the charming bedchamber that had been
allotted to him anthony shook his head several times “i’m wrong ” he said to himself “for the second time i’m wrong somehow or other i can’t get the hang of this thing ”
he stopped in his pacing of the floor “what the devil——” began anthony the door was being softly opened in another minute a man had slipped
into the room and stood deferentially by the door he was a big fair man squarely built with high slavonic cheek-bones and dreamy fanatic eyes “who the devil are you ” asked anthony staring at him the man replied in perfect english “i am boris anchoukoff ”
“prince michael’s servant eh ”
“that is so i served my master he is dead now i serve you ”
“it’s very kind of you ” said anthony “but i don’t happen to want a
valet ”
“you are my master now i will serve you faithfully ”
“yes—but—look here—i don’t need a valet i can’t afford one ”
boris anchoukoff looked at him with a touch of scorn “i do not ask for money i served my master so will i serve you—to
the death ”
stepping quickly forward he dropped on one knee caught anthony’s hand
and placed it on his forehead then he rose swiftly and left the room
as suddenly as he had come anthony stared after him his face a picture of astonishment “that’s damned odd ” he said to himself “a faithful sort of dog curious the instincts these fellows have ”
he rose and paced up and down “all the same ” he muttered “it’s awkward—damned awkward—just at
present ”"
Chapter 17,"17
a midnight adventure
the inquest took place on the following morning it was extraordinarily
unlike the inquests as pictured in sensational fiction it satisfied
even george lomax in its rigid suppression of all interesting details superintendent battle and the coroner working together with the
support of the chief constable had reduced the proceedings to the
lowest level of boredom immediately after the inquest anthony took an unostentatious departure his departure was the one bright spot in the day for bill eversleigh george lomax obsessed with the fear that something damaging to his
department might leak out had been exceedingly trying miss oscar and
bill had been in constant attendance everything useful and interesting
had been done by miss oscar bill’s part had been to run to and fro
with countless messages to decode telegrams and to listen by the hour
to george repeating himself it was a completely exhausted young man who retired to bed on saturday
night he had had practically no chance to talk to virginia all
day owing to george’s exactions and he felt injured and ill-used thank goodness that colonial fellow had taken himself off he had
monopolized far too much of virginia’s society anyway and of course
if george lomax went on making an ass of himself like this—— his
mind seething with resentment bill fell asleep and in dreams came
consolation for he dreamt of virginia it was an heroic dream a dream of burning timbers in which he played
the part of the gallant rescuer he brought down virginia from the
topmost story in his arms she was unconscious he laid her on the
grass then he went off to find a packet of sandwiches it was most
important that he should find that packet of sandwiches george had it but instead of giving it up to bill he began to dictate telegrams they were now in the vestry of a church and any minute virginia might
arrive to be married to him horror he was wearing pyjamas he must
get home at once and find his proper clothes he rushed out to the
car the car would not start no petrol in the tank he was getting
desperate and then a big general ’bus drew up and virginia got out
of it on the arm of the bald headed baron she was deliciously cool and exquisitely dressed in grey she came over to him and shook him by
the shoulders playfully “bill ” she said “oh bill ” she shook him
harder “bill ” she said “wake up oh do wake up ”
very dazed bill woke up he was in his bedroom at chimneys but part
of the dream was with him still virginia was leaning over him and was
repeating the same words with variations “wake up bill oh do wake up bill ”
“hullo ” said bill sitting up in bed “what’s the matter ”
virginia gave a sigh of relief “thank goodness i thought you’d never wake up i’ve been shaking you
and shaking you are you properly awake now ”
“i think so ” said bill doubtfully “you great lump ” said virginia “the trouble i’ve had my arms are
aching ”
“these insults are uncalled for ” said bill with dignity “let me say virginia that i consider your conduct most unbecoming not at all that
of a pure young widow ”
“don’t be an idiot bill things are happening ”
“what kind of things ”
“queer things in the council chamber i thought i heard a door bang
somewhere and i came down to see and then saw a light in the council
chamber i crept along the passage and peeped through the crack of the
door i couldn’t see much but what i could see was so extraordinary
that i felt i must see more and then all of a sudden i felt that i
should like a nice big strong man with me and you were the nicest
and biggest and strongest man i could think of so i came in and tried
to wake you up quietly but i’ve been ages doing it ”
“i see ” said bill “and what do you want me to do now get up and
tackle the burglars ”
virginia wrinkled her brows “i’m not sure that they are burglars bill it’s very queer—— but
don’t let’s waste time talking get up ”
bill slipped obediently out of bed “wait while i don a pair of boots—the big ones with nails in them however big and strong i am i’m not going to tackle hardened criminals
with bare feet ”
“i like your pyjamas bill ” said virginia dreamily “brightness
without vulgarity ”
“while we’re on the subject ” remarked bill reaching for his second
boot “i like that thingummybob of yours it’s a pretty shade of green what do you call it it’s not just a dressing-gown is it ”
“it’s a _négligé_” said virginia “i’m glad you’ve led such a pure
life bill ”
“i haven’t ” said bill indignantly “you’ve just betrayed the fact you’re very nice bill and i like you i dare say that to-morrow morning—say about ten o’clock a good safe
hour for not unduly exciting the emotions—i might even kiss you ”
“i always think these things are best carried out on the spur of the
moment ” suggested bill “we’ve other fish to fry ” said virginia “if you don’t want to put on
a gas mask and a shirt of chain mail shall we start ”
“i’m ready ” said bill he wriggled into a lurid silk dressing-gown and picked up a poker “the orthodox weapon ” he observed “come on ” said virginia “and don’t make a noise ”
they crept out of the room and along the corridor and then down the
wide double staircase virginia frowned as they reached the bottom of
it “those boots of yours aren’t exactly domes of silence are they bill ”
“nails will be nails ” said bill “i’m doing my best ”
“you’ll have to take them off ” said virginia firmly bill groaned “you can carry them in your hand i want to see if you can make out
what’s going on in the council chamber bill it’s awfully mysterious why should burglars take a man in armour to pieces ”
“well i suppose they can’t take him away whole very well they
disarticulate him and pack him neatly ”
virginia shook her head dissatisfied “what should they want to steal a mouldy old suit of armour for why chimneys is full of treasures that are much easier to take away ”
bill shook his head “how many of them are there ” he asked taking a firmer grip of his
poker “i couldn’t see properly you know what a keyhole is and they only had
a flashlight ”
“i expect they’ve gone by now ” said bill hopefully he sat down on the bottom stair and drew off his boots then holding
them in his hand he crept along the passage that led to the council
chamber virginia close behind him they halted outside the massive oak
door all was silent within but suddenly virginia pressed his arm and
he nodded a bright light had shown for a minute through the keyhole bill went down on his knees and applied his eye to the orifice what
he saw was confusing in the extreme the scene of the drama that was
being enacted inside was evidently just to the left out of his line
of vision a subdued chink every now and then seemed to point to the
fact that the invaders were still dealing with the figure in armour there were two of these bill remembered they stood together by the
wall just under the holbein portrait the light of the electric torch
was evidently being directed upon the operations in progress it
left the rest of the room nearly in darkness once a figure flitted
across bill’s line of vision but there was not sufficient light to
distinguish anything about it it might have been that of a man or a
woman in a minute or two it flitted back again and then the subdued
chinking sounded again presently there came a new sound a faint
tap-tap as of knuckles on wood bill sat back on his heels suddenly “what is it ” whispered virginia “nothing it’s no good going on like this we can’t see anything and
we can’t guess what they’re up to i must go in and tackle them ”
he drew on his boots and stood up “now virginia listen to me we’ll open the door as softly as
possible you know where the switch of the electric light is ”
“yes just by the door ”
“i don’t think there are more than two of them there may be only one i want to get well into the room then when i say ‘go’ i want you to
switch on the lights do you understand ”
“perfectly ”
“and don’t scream or faint or anything i won’t let anyone hurt you ”
“my hero ” murmured virginia bill peered at her suspiciously through the darkness he heard a faint
sound which might have been either a sob or a laugh then he grasped
the poker firmly and rose to his feet he felt that he was fully alive
to the situation very softly he turned the handle of the door it yielded and swung
gently inwards bill felt virginia close beside him together they
moved noiselessly into the room at the farther end of the room the torch was playing upon the holbein
picture silhouetted against it was the figure of a man standing on a
chair and gently tapping on the panelling his back of course was to
them and he merely loomed up as a monstrous shadow what more they might have seen cannot be told for at that moment
bill’s nails squeaked upon the parquet floor the man swung round directing the powerful torch full upon them and almost dazzling them
with the sudden glare bill did not hesitate “go ” he roared to virginia and sprang for his man as she obediently
pressed down the switch of the electric lights the big chandelier should have been flooded with light; but instead all that happened was the click of the switch the room remained in
darkness virginia heard bill curse freely the next minute the air was filled
with panting scuffling sounds the torch had fallen to the ground and
extinguished itself in the fall there was the sound of a desperate
struggle going on in the darkness but as to who was getting the better
of it and indeed as to who was taking part in it virginia had no
idea had there been anyone else in the room besides the man who was
tapping the panelling there might have been their glimpse had been
only a momentary one virginia felt paralysed she hardly knew what to do she dared not try
and join in the struggle to do so might hamper and not aid bill her
one idea was to stay in the doorway so that anyone trying to escape
should not leave the room that way at the same time she disobeyed
bill’s express instructions and screamed loudly and repeatedly for help she heard doors opening upstairs and a sudden gleam of light from the
hall and the big staircase if only bill could hold his man until help
came but at that minute there was a final terrific upheaval they must have
crashed into one of the figures in armour for it fell to the ground
with a deafening noise virginia saw dimly a figure springing for the
window and at the same time heard bill cursing and disengaging himself
from fragments of armour for the first time she left her post and rushed wildly for the figure
at the window but the window was already unlatched the intruder had
no need to stop and fumble for it he sprang out and raced away down
the terrace and round the corner of the house virginia raced after
him she was young and athletic and she turned the corner of the
terrace not many seconds after her quarry but there she ran headlong into the arms of a man who was emerging from
a small side door it was mr hiram p fish “gee it’s a lady ” he exclaimed “why i beg your pardon mrs revel i took you for one of the thugs fleeing from justice ”
“he’s just passed this way ” cried virginia breathlessly “can’t we
catch him ”
but even as she spoke she knew it was too late the man must have
gained the park by now and it was a dark night with no moon she
retraced her steps to the council chamber mr fish by her side discoursing in a soothing monotone upon the habits of burglars in
general of which he seemed to have a wide experience lord caterham bundle and various frightened servants were standing in
the doorway of the council chamber “what the devil’s the matter ” asked bundle “is it burglars what are
you and mr fish doing virginia taking a midnight stroll ”
virginia explained the events of the evening “how frightfully exciting ” commented bundle “you don’t usually get
a murder and a burglary crowded into one week-end what’s the matter
with the lights in here they’re all right everywhere else ”
that mystery was soon explained the bulbs had simply been removed
and laid in a row against the wall mounted on a pair of steps the
dignified tredwell dignified even in undress restored illumination to
the stricken apartment “if i am not mistaken ” said lord caterham in his sad voice as he
looked around him “this room has recently been the centre of somewhat
violent activity ”
there was some justice in the remark everything that could have
been knocked over had been knocked over the floor was littered with
splintered chairs broken china and fragments of armour “how many of them were there ” asked bundle “it seems to have been a
desperate fight ”
“only one i think ” said virginia but even as she spoke she
hesitated a little certainly only one person—a man—had passed out
through the window but as she had rushed after him she had had a
vague impression of a rustle somewhere close at hand if so the second
occupant of the room could have escaped through the door perhaps though the rustle had been an effect of her own imagination bill appeared suddenly at the window he was out of breath and panting
hard “damn the fellow ” he exclaimed wrathfully “he’s escaped i’ve been
hunting all over the place not a sign of him ”
“cheer up bill ” said virginia “better luck next time ”
“well ” said lord caterham “what do you think we’d better do now go
back to bed i can’t get hold of badgworthy at this time of night tredwell you know the sort of thing that’s necessary just see to it will you ”
“very good my lord ”
with a sigh of relief lord caterham prepared to retreat “that beggar isaacstein sleeps soundly ” he remarked with a touch of
envy “you’d have thought all this row would have brought him down ” he
looked across at mr fish “you found time to dress i see ” he added “i flung on a few articles of clothing yes ” admitted the american “very sensible of you ” said lord caterham “damned chilly things pyjamas ”
he yawned in a rather depressed mood the house party retired to bed "

second midnight adventure
the first person that anthony saw as he alighted from his train on the
following afternoon was superintendent battle his face broke into a
smile “i’ve returned according to contract ” he remarked “did you come down
here to assure yourself of the fact ”
battle shook his head “i wasn’t worrying about that mr cade i happen to be going to
london that’s all ”
“you have such a trustful nature battle ”
“do you think so sir ”
“no i think you’re deep—very deep still waters you know and all
that sort of thing so you’re going to london ”
“i am mr cade ”
“i wonder why ”
the detective did not reply “you’re so chatty ” remarked anthony “that’s what i like about you ”
a far-off twinkle showed in battle’s eyes “what about your own little job mr cade ” he inquired “how did that
go off ”
“i’ve drawn blank battle for the second time i’ve been proved
hopelessly wrong galling isn’t it ”
“what was the idea sir if i may ask ”
“i suspected the french governess battle a: upon the grounds of her
being the most unlikely person according to the canons of the best
fiction b: because there was a light in her room on the night of the
tragedy ”
“that wasn’t much to go upon ”
“you are quite right it was not but i discovered that she had only
been here a short time and i also found a suspicious frenchman spying
round the place you know all about him i suppose ”
“you mean the man who calls himself m chelles staying at the
_cricketers_ a traveller in silk ”
“that’s it is it what about him what does scotland yard think ”
“his actions have been suspicious ” said superintendent battle
expressionlessly “very suspicious i should say well i put two and two together french governess in the house french stranger outside i decided that
they were in league together and i hurried off to interview the lady
with whom mademoiselle brun had lived for the last ten years i was
fully prepared to find that she had never heard of any such person as
mademoiselle brun but i was wrong battle mademoiselle is the genuine
article ”
battle nodded “i must admit ” said anthony “that as soon as i spoke to her i had an
uneasy conviction that i was barking up the wrong tree she seemed so
absolutely the governess ”
again battle nodded “all the same mr cade you can’t always go by that women especially
can do a lot with make up i’ve seen quite a pretty girl with the color
of her hair altered a sallow complexion stain slightly reddened
eyelids and most efficacious of all dowdy clothes who would fail to
be identified by nine people out of ten who had seen her in her former
character men haven’t got quite the same pull you can do something
with the eyebrows and of course different sets of false teeth alter
the whole expression but there are always the ears—there’s an
extraordinary lot of character in ears mr cade ”
“don’t look so hard at mine battle ” complained anthony “you make me
quite nervous ”
“i’m not talking of false beard and grease paint ” continued the
superintendent “that’s only for books no there are very few men
who can escape identification and put it over on you in fact there’s
only one man i know who has a positive genius for impersonation king
victor ever heard of king victor mr cade ”
there was something so sharp and sudden about the way the detective put
the question that anthony half checked the words that were rising to
his lips “king victor ” he said reflectively instead “somehow i seem to have
heard the name ”
“one of the most celebrated jewel thieves in the world irish father french mother can speak five languages at least he’s been serving a
sentence but his time was up a few months ago ”
“really and where is he supposed to be now ”
“well mr cade that’s what we’d rather like to know ”
“the plot thickens ” said anthony lightly “no chance of his turning up
here is there but i suppose he wouldn’t be interested in political
memoirs—only in jewels ”
“there’s no saying ” said superintendent battle “for all we know he
may be here already ”
“disguised as the second footman splendid you’ll recognize him by his
ears and cover yourself with glory ”
“quite fond of your little joke aren’t you mr cade by the way what
do you think of that curious business at staines ”
“staines ” said anthony “what’s been happening at staines ”
“it was in saturday’s papers i thought you might have seen about it man found by the roadside shot a foreigner it was in the papers again
to-day of course ”
“i did see something about it ” said anthony carelessly “not suicide apparently ”
“no there was no weapon as yet the man hasn’t been identified ”
“you seem very interested ” said anthony smiling “no connection with
prince michael’s death is there ”
his hand was quite steady so were his eyes was it his fancy that
superintendent battle was looking at him with peculiar intentness “seems to be quite an epidemic of that sort of thing ” said battle “but well i dare say there’s nothing in it ”
he turned away beckoning to a porter as the london train came
thundering in anthony drew a faint sigh of relief he strolled across the park in an unusually thoughtful mood he
purposely chose to approach the house from the same direction as that
from which he had come on the fateful thursday night and as he drew
near to it he looked up at the windows cudgelling his brains to make
sure of the one where he had seen the light was he quite sure that it
was the second from the end and doing so he made a discovery there was an angle at the corner of
the house in which was a window set farther back standing on one spot you counted this window as the first and the first one built out over
the council chamber as the second but move a few yards to the right
and the part built out over the council chamber appeared to be the end
of the house the first window was invisible and the two windows of
the rooms over the council chamber would have appeared the first and
second from the end where exactly had he been standing when he had
seen the light flash up anthony found the question very hard to determine a matter of a yard
or so made all the difference but one point was made abundantly clear it was quite possible that he had been mistaken in describing the light
as occurring in the second room from the end it might equally well
have been the _third_ now who occupied the third room anthony was determined to find that
out as soon as possible fortune favoured him in the hall tredwell had
just set the massive silver urn in its place on the tea tray nobody
else was there “hullo tredwell ” said anthony “i wanted to ask you something who
has the third room from the end on the west side over the council
chamber i mean ”
tredwell reflected for a minute or two “that would be the american gentleman’s room sir mr fish ”
“oh is it thank you ”
“not at all sir ”
tredwell prepared to depart then paused the desire to be the first to
impart news makes even pontifical butlers human “perhaps you have heard sir of what occurred last night ”
“not a word ” said anthony “what did occur last night ”
“an attempt at robbery sir ”
“not really was anything taken ”
“no sir the thieves were dismantling the suits of armour in
the council chamber when they were surprised and forced to flee unfortunately they got clear away ”
“that’s very extraordinary ” said anthony “the council chamber again did they break in that way ”
“it is supposed sir that they forced the window ”
satisfied with the interest his information had aroused tredwell
resumed his retreat but brought up short with a dignified apology “i beg your pardon sir i didn’t hear you come in and i didn’t know
you were standing just behind me ”
mr isaacstein who had been the victim of the impact waved his hand in
a friendly fashion “no harm done my good fellow i assure you no harm done ”
tredwell retired looking contemptuous and isaacstein came forward and
dropped into an easy-chair “hullo cade so you’re back again been hearing all about last night’s
little show ”
“yes ” said anthony “rather an exciting week-end isn’t it ”
“i should imagine that last night was the work of local men ” said
isaacstein “it seems a clumsy amateurish affair ”
“is there anyone about here who collects armour ” asked anthony “it
seems a curious thing to select ”
“very curious ” agreed mr isaacstein he paused a minute and then
said slowly: “the whole position here is very unfortunate ”
there was something almost menacing in his tone “i don’t quite understand ” said anthony “why are we all being kept here in this way the inquest was over
yesterday the prince’s body will be removed to london where it is
being given out that he died of heart failure and still nobody is
allowed to leave the house mr lomax knows no more than i do he
refers me to superintendent battle ”
“superintendent battle has something up his sleeve ” said anthony
thoughtfully “and it seems the essence of his plan that nobody should
leave ”
“but excuse me mr cade you have been away ”
“with a string tied to my leg i’ve no doubt that i was shadowed the
whole time i shouldn’t have been given a chance of disposing of the
revolver or anything of that kind ”
“ah the revolver ” said isaacstein thoughtfully “that has not yet
been found i think ”
“not yet ”
“possibly thrown into the lake in passing ”
“very possibly ”
“where is superintendent battle i have not seen him this afternoon ”
“he’s gone to london i met him at the station ”
“gone to london really did he say when he would be back ”
“early to-morrow so i understood ”
virginia came in with lord caterham and mr fish she smiled a welcome
at anthony “so you’re back mr cade have you heard all about our adventures last
night ”
“why trooly mr cade ” said hiram fish “it was a night of strenuous
excitement did you hear that i mistook mrs revel for one of the
thugs ”
“and in the meantime ” said anthony “the thug—— ”
“got clear away ” said mr fish mournfully “do pour out ” said lord caterham to virginia “i don’t know where
bundle is ”
virginia officiated then she came and sat down near anthony “come to the boat-house after tea ” she said in a low voice “bill and
i have got a lot to tell you ”
then she joined lightly in the general conversation the meeting at the boat-house was duly held virginia and bill were bubbling over with their news they agreed
that a boat in the middle of the lake was the only safe place for
confidential conversation having paddled out a sufficient distance the full story of last night’s adventure was related to anthony bill
looked a little sulky he wished virginia would not insist on bringing
this colonial fellow into it “it’s very odd ” said anthony when the story was finished “what do
you make of it ” he asked virginia “i think they were looking for something ” she returned promptly “the
burglar idea is absurd ”
“they thought the something whatever it was might be concealed in
the suits of armour that’s clear enough but why tap the panelling that looks more as though they were looking for a secret staircase or
something of that kind ”
“there’s a priest’s hole at chimneys i know ” said virginia “and i
believe there’s a secret staircase as well lord caterham would tell us
all about it what i want to know is what can they have been looking
for ”
“it can’t be the memoirs ” said anthony “they’re a great bulky
package it must have been something small ”
“george knows i expect ” said virginia “i wonder whether i could get
it out of him all along i’ve felt there was something behind all this ”
“you say there was only one man ” pursued anthony “but that there
might possibly be another as you thought you heard some one going
towards the door as you sprang to the window ”
“the sound was very slight ” said virginia “it might have been just my
imagination ”
“that’s quite possible but in case it wasn’t your imagination the
second person must have been an inmate of the house i wonder now——”
“what are you wondering at ” asked virginia “the thoroughness of mr hiram fish who dresses himself completely when
he hears screams for help downstairs ”
“there’s something in that ” agreed virginia “and then there’s
isaacstein who sleeps through it all that’s suspicious too surely he
couldn’t ”
“there’s that fellow boris ” suggested bill “he looks an unmitigated
ruffian michael’s servant i mean ”
“chimneys is full of suspicious characters ” said virginia “i dare
say the others are just as suspicious of us i wish superintendent
battle hadn’t gone to london i think it’s rather stupid of him by the
way mr cade i’ve seen that peculiar-looking frenchman about once or
twice spying round the park ”
“it’s a mix up ” confessed anthony “i’ve been away on a wild-goose
chase made a thorough ass of myself look here to me the whole
question seems to resolve itself into this: did the men find what they
were looking for last night ”
“supposing they didn’t ” said virginia “i’m pretty sure they didn’t as a matter of fact ”
“just this i believe they’ll come again they know or they soon will
know that battle’s in london they’ll take the risk and come again
to-night ”
“do you really think so ”
“it’s a chance now we three will form a little syndicate eversleigh
and i will conceal ourselves with due precautions in the council
chamber——”
“what about me ” interrupted virginia “don’t think you’re going to
leave me out of it ”
“listen to me virginia ” said bill “this is man’s work——”
“don’t be an idiot bill i’m in on this don’t you make any mistake
about it the syndicate will keep watch to-night ”
it was settled thus and the details of the plan were laid after the
party had retired to bed first one and then another of the syndicate
crept down they were all armed with powerful electric torches and in
the pocket of anthony’s coat lay a revolver anthony had said that he believed another attempt to resume the search
would be made nevertheless he did not expect that the attempt would
be made from outside he believed that virginia had been correct in her
guess that some one had passed her in the dark the night before and as
he stood in the shadow of an old oak dresser it was towards the door
and not the window that his eyes were directed virginia was crouching
behind a figure in armour on the opposite wall and bill was by the
window the minutes passed at interminable length one o’clock chimed then
the half-hour then two then another half-hour anthony felt stiff and
cramped he was coming slowly to the conclusion that he had been wrong no attempt would be made to-night and then he stiffened suddenly all his senses on the alert he had
heard a footstep on the terrace outside silence again then a low
scratching noise at the window suddenly it ceased and the window
swung open a man stepped across the sill into the room he stood quite still for a moment peering round as though listening after a minute or two seemingly satisfied he switched on a torch
he carried and turned it rapidly round the room apparently he saw
nothing unusual the three watchers held their breath he went over to the same bit of panelled wall he had been examining the
night before and then a terrible knowledge smote bill he was going to sneeze the
wild race through the dew-laden park the night before had given him a
chill all day he had sneezed intermittently a sneeze was due now and
nothing on earth would stop it he adopted all the remedies he could think of he pressed his upper
lip swallowed hard threw back his head and looked at the ceiling as
a last resort he held his nose and pinched it violently it was of no
avail he sneezed a stifled checked emasculated sneeze but a startling sound in the
deadly quiet of the room the stranger sprang round and in the same minute anthony acted he
flashed on his torch and jumped full for the stranger in another
minute they were down on the floor together “lights ” shouted anthony virginia was ready at the switch the lights came on true and full
to-night anthony was on top of his man bill leant down to give him a
hand “and now ” said anthony “let’s see who you are my fine fellow ”
he rolled his victim over it was the neat dark-bearded stranger from
the _cricketers_ “very nice indeed ” said an approving voice they all looked up startled the bulky form of superintendent battle
was standing in the open doorway “i thought you were in london superintendent battle ” said anthony battle’s eyes twinkled “did you sir ” he said “well i thought it would be a good thing if i
was thought to be going ”
“and it has been ” agreed anthony looking down at his prostrate foe to his surprise there was a slight smile on the stranger’s face “may i get up gentlemen ” he inquired “you are three to one ”
anthony kindly hauled him on to his legs the stranger settled his
coat pulled up his collar and directed a keen look at battle “i demand pardon ” he said “but do i understand that you are a
representative from scotland yard ”
“that’s right ” said battle “then i will present to you my credentials ” he smiled rather ruefully “i would have been wise to do so before ”
he took some papers from his pocket and handed them to the scotland
yard detective at the same time he turned back the lapel of his coat
and showed something pinned there battle gave an exclamation of astonishment he looked through the
papers and handed them back with a little bow “i’m sorry you’ve been man-handled monsieur ” he said “but you
brought it on yourself you know ”
he smiled noting the astonished expression on the faces of the other “this is a colleague we have been expecting for some time ” he said “m lemoine of the sûreté in paris ”"
Chapter 19,"19
secret history
they all stared at the french detective who smiled back at them “but yes ” he said “it is true ”
there was a pause for a general readjusting of ideas then virginia
turned to battle “do you know what i think superintendent battle ”
“what do you think mrs revel ”
“i think the time has come to enlighten us a little ”
“to enlighten you i don’t quite understand mrs revel ”
“superintendent battle you understand perfectly i dare say mr lomax
has hedged you about with recommendations of secrecy—george would but surely it’s better to tell us than have us stumbling on the secret
all by ourselves and perhaps doing untold harm m lemoine don’t you
agree with me ”
“madame i agree with you entirely ”
“you can’t go on keeping things dark for ever ” said battle “i’ve
told mr lomax so mr eversleigh is mr lomax’s secretary there’s no
objection to his knowing what there is to know as for mr cade he’s
been brought into the thing willy-nilly and i consider he’s a right to
know where he stands but——”
battle paused “i know ” said virginia “women are so indiscreet i’ve often heard
george say so ”
lemoine had been studying virginia attentively now he turned to the
scotland yard man “did i hear you just now address madame by the name of revel ”
“that is my name ” said virginia “your husband was in the diplomatic service was he not and you were
with him in herzoslovakia just before the assassination of the late
king and queen ”
“yes ”
lemoine turned again “i think madame has a right to hear the story she is indirectly
concerned moreover”—his eyes twinkled a little—“madame’s reputation
for discretion stands very high in diplomatic circles ”
“i’m glad they give me a good character ” said virginia laughing “and
i’m glad i’m not going to be left out of it ”
“what about refreshments ” said anthony “where does the conference
take place here ”
“if you please sir ” said battle “i’ve a fancy for not leaving this
room until morning you’ll see why when you’ve heard the story ”
“then i’ll go and forage ” said anthony bill went with him and they returned with a tray of glasses siphons
and other necessaries of life the augmented syndicate established itself comfortably in the corner by
the window being grouped round a long oak table “it’s understood of course ” said battle “that anything that’s said
here is said in strict confidence there must be no leakage i’ve
always felt it would come out one of these days gentlemen like mr lomax who want everything hushed up take bigger risks than they think the start of this business was just over seven years ago there was a
lot of what they call reconstruction going on—especially in the near
east there was a good deal going on in england strictly on the q t with that old gentleman count stylptitch pulling the strings all
the balkan states were interested parties and there were a lot of
royal personages in england just then i’m not going into details but something disappeared—disappeared in a way that seemed incredible
unless you admitted two things—that the thief was a royal personage
and that at the same time it was the work of a high-class professional m lemoine here will tell you how that well might be ”
the frenchman bowed courteously and took up the tale “it is possible that you in england may not even have heard of our
famous and fantastic king victor what his real name is no one knows but he is a man of singular courage and daring one who speaks five
languages and is unequalled in the art of disguise though his father
is known to have been either english or irish he himself has worked
chiefly in paris it was there nearly eight years ago that he was
carrying out a daring series of robberies and living under the name of
captain o’neill ”
a faint exclamation escaped virginia m lemoine darted a keen glance
at her “i think i understand what agitates madame you will see in a minute now we of the sûreté had our suspicions that this captain o’neill was
none other than ‘king victor ’ but we could not obtain the necessary
proof there was also in paris at the time a clever young actress angèle mory of the folies bergères for some time we had suspected
that she was associated with the operations of king victor but again
no proof was forthcoming “about that time paris was preparing for the visit of the young king
nicholas iv of herzoslovakia at the sûreté we were given special
instructions as to the course to be adopted to ensure the safety of his
majesty in particular we were warned to superintend the activities of
a certain revolutionary organization which called itself the comrades
of the red hand it is fairly certain now that the comrades approached
angèle mory and offered her a huge sum if she would aid them in their
plans her part was to infatuate the young king and decoy him to
some spot agreed upon with them angèle mory accepted the bribe and
promised to perform her part “but the young lady was cleverer and more ambitious than her employers
suspected she succeeded in captivating the king who fell desperately
in love with her and loaded her with jewels it was then that she
conceived the idea of being—not a king’s mistress but a queen as
every one knows she realized her ambition she was introduced into
herzoslovakia as the countess varaga popoleffsky an offshoot of the
romanoffs and became eventually queen varaga of herzoslovakia not
bad for a little parisian actress i have always heard that she played
the part extremely well but her triumph was not to be long lived the
comrades of the red hand furious at her betrayal twice attempted
her life finally they worked up the country to such a pitch that a
revolution broke out in which both the king and queen perished their
bodies horribly mutilated and hardly recognizable were recovered attesting to the fury of the populace against the low-born foreign
queen “now in all this it seems certain that queen varaga still kept in
with her confederate king victor it is possible that the bold plan
was his all along what is known is that she continued to correspond
with him in a secret code from the court of herzoslovakia for safety
the letters were written in english and signed with the name of an
english lady then at the embassy if any inquiry had been made and
the lady in question had denied her signature it is possible that she
would not have been believed for the letters were those of a guilty
woman to her lover it was your name she used mrs revel ”
“i know ” said virginia her colour was coming and going unevenly “so
that is the truth of the letters i have wondered and wondered ”
“what a blackguardly trick ” cried bill indignantly “the letters were addressed to captain o’neill at his rooms in paris and their principal purpose may have light shed upon it by a curious
fact which came to light later after the assassination of the king
and queen many of the crown jewels which had fallen of course into
the hands of the mob found their way to paris and it was discovered
that in nine cases out of ten the principal stones had been replaced
by paste—and mind you there were some very famous stones among the
jewels of herzoslovakia so as a queen angèle mory still practised her
former activities “you see now where we have arrived nicholas iv and queen varaga came
to england and were the guests of the late marquis of caterham then
secretary of state for foreign affairs herzoslovakia is a small
country but it could not be left out queen varaga was necessarily
received and there we have a royal personage and at the same time an
expert thief there is also no doubt that the—er—substitute which was
so wonderful as to deceive anyone but an expert could only have been
fashioned by king victor and indeed the whole plan in its daring and
audacity pointed to him as the author ”
“what happened ” asked virginia “hushed up ” said superintendent battle laconically “not a mention of
it’s ever been made public to this day we did all that could be done
on the quiet—and that was a good deal more than you’d ever imagine by
the way we’ve got methods of our own that would surprise that jewel
didn’t leave england with the queen of herzoslovakia—i can tell you
that much no her majesty hid it somewhere—but where we’ve never been
able to discover but i shouldn’t wonder”—superintendent battle let
his eyes wander gently round—“if it wasn’t somewhere in this room ”
anthony leapt to his feet “what after all these years ” he cried incredulously “impossible ”
“you do not know the peculiar circumstances monsieur ” said the
frenchman quickly “only a fortnight later the revolution in
herzoslovakia broke out and the king and queen were murdered also captain o’neill was arrested in paris and sentenced on a minor charge we hoped to find the packet of code letters in his house but it
appears that this had been stolen by some herzoslovakian go-between the man turned up in herzoslovakia just before the revolution and then
disappeared completely ”
“he probably went abroad ” said anthony thoughtfully “to africa as
likely as not and you bet he hung on to that packet it was as good
as a gold mine to him it’s odd how things come about they probably
called him dutch pedro or something like that out there ”
he caught superintendent battle’s expressionless glance bent upon him and smiled “it’s not really clairvoyance battle ” he said “though it sounds like
it i’ll tell you presently ”
“there is one thing you have not explained ” said virginia “where does
this link up with the memoirs there must be a link surely ”
“madame is very quick ” said lemoine approvingly “yes there is a
link count stylptitch was also staying at chimneys at the time ”
“so that he might have known about it ”
“_parfaitement _”
“and of course ” said battle “if he’s blurted it out in his precious
memoirs the fat will be in the fire especially after the way the
whole thing was hushed up ”
anthony lit a cigarette “there’s no possibility of there being a clue in the memoirs as to
where the stone was hidden ” he asked “very unlikely ” said battle decisively “he was never in with the
queen—opposed the marriage tooth and nail she’s not likely to have
taken him into her confidence ”
“i wasn’t suggesting such a thing for a minute ” said anthony “but
by all accounts he was a cunning old boy unknown to her he may have
discovered where she hid the jewel in that case what would he have
done do you think ”
“sat tight ” said battle after a moment’s reflection “i agree ” said the frenchman “it was a ticklish moment you see to
return the stone anonymously would have presented great difficulties also the knowledge of its whereabouts would give him great power—and
he liked power that strange old man not only did he hold the queen
in the hollow of his hand but he had a powerful weapon to negotiate
with at any time it was not the only secret he possessed—oh no —he
collected secrets like some men collect rare pieces of china it is
said that once or twice before his death he boasted to people of the
things he could make public if the fancy took him and once at least
he declared that he intended to make some startling revelations in
his memoirs hence”—the frenchman smiled rather dryly—“the general
anxiety to get hold of them our own secret police intended to seize
them but the count took the precaution to have them conveyed away
before his death ”
“still there’s no real reason to believe that he knew this particular
secret ” said battle “i beg your pardon ” said anthony quietly “there are his own words ”
“what ”
both detectives stared at him as though unable to believe their ears “when mr mcgrath gave me that manuscript to bring to england he
told me the circumstances of his one meeting with count stylptitch it was in paris at some considerable risk to himself mr mcgrath
rescued the count from a band of apaches he was i understand—shall
we say a trifle—exhilarated being in that condition he made two
rather interesting remarks one of them was to the effect that he knew
where the koh-i-noor was—a statement to which my friend paid very
little attention he also said that the gang in question were king
victor’s men taken together those two remarks are very significant ”
“good lord ” ejaculated superintendent battle “i should say they were even the murder of prince michael wears a different aspect ”
“king victor has never taken a life ” the frenchman reminded him “supposing he were surprised when he was searching for the jewel ”
“is he in england then ” asked anthony sharply “you say that he was
released a few months ago didn’t you keep track of him ”
a rather rueful smile overspread the french detective’s face “we tried to monsieur but he is a devil that man he gave us the
slip at once—at once we thought of course that he would make
straight for england but no he went—where do you think ”
“where ” said anthony he was staring intently at the frenchman and absent-mindedly his
fingers played with a box of matches “to america to the united states ”
“what ”
there was sheer amazement in anthony’s tone “yes and what do you think he called himself what part do you think
he played over there the part of prince nicholas of herzoslovakia ”
the match-box fell from anthony’s hand but his amazement was fully
equalled by that of battle “impossible ”
“not so my friend you too will get the news in the morning it
has been the most colossal bluff as you know prince nicholas was
rumoured to have died in the congo years ago our friend king victor seizes on that—difficult to prove a death of that kind he resurrects
prince nicholas and plays him to such purpose that he gets away with a
tremendous haul of american dollars—all on account of the supposed oil
concessions but by a mere accident he was unmasked and had to leave
the country hurriedly this time he did come to england and that is
why i am here sooner or later he will come to chimneys that is if he
is not already here ”
“you think—that ”
“i think he was here the night prince michael died and again last
night ”
“it was another attempt eh ” said battle “it was another attempt ”
“what has bothered me ” continued battle “was wondering what had
become of m lemoine here i’d had word from paris that he was on his
way over to work with me and i couldn’t make out why he hadn’t turned
up ”
“i must indeed apologize ” said lemoine “you see i arrived on the
morning after the murder it occurred to me at once that it would
be as well for me to study things from an unofficial standpoint
without appearing officially as your colleague i thought that great
possibilities lay that way i was of course aware that i was bound to
be an object of suspicion but that in a way furthered my plan since it
would not put people i was after on their guard i can assure you that
i have seen a good deal that is interesting in the last two days ”
“but look here ” said bill “what really did happen last night ”
“i am afraid ” said m lemoine “that i gave you rather violent
exercise ”
“it was you i chased then ”
“yes i will recount things to you i came up here to watch convinced
that the secret had to do with this room since the prince had been
killed here i stood outside on the terrace presently i became aware
that some one was moving about in this room i could see the flash of a
torch now and again i tried the middle window and found it unlatched whether the man had entered that way earlier or whether he had left
it so as a blind in case he was disturbed i do not know very gently i pushed it back and slipped inside the room step by step i felt
my way until i was in a spot where i could watch operations without
likelihood of being discovered myself the man himself i could not see
clearly his back was to me of course and he was silhouetted against
the light of the torch so that his outline only could be seen but his
actions filled me with surprise he took to pieces first one and then
the other of those two suits of armour examining each one piece by
piece when he had convinced himself that what he sought was not there he began tapping the panelling of the wall under that picture what he
would have done next i do not know the interruption came _you_ burst
in——” he looked at bill “our well-meant interference was really rather a pity ” said virginia
thoughtfully “in a sense madame it was the man switched out his torch and i who
had no wish as yet to be forced to reveal my identity sprang for the
window i collided with the other two in the dark and fell headlong i
sprang up and out through the window mr eversleigh taking me for his
assailant followed ”
“i followed you first ” said virginia “bill was only second in the
race ”
“and the other fellow had the sense to stay still and sneak out through
the door i wonder he didn’t meet the rescuing crowd ”
“that would present no difficulties ” said lemoine “he would be a
rescuer in advance of the rest that was all ”
“do you really think this arsène lupin fellow is actually among the
household now ” asked bill his eyes sparkling “why not ” said lemoine “he could pass perfectly as a servant for all
we may know he may be boris anchoukoff the trusted servant of the
late prince michael ”
“he is an odd-looking bloke ” agreed bill but anthony was smiling “that’s hardly worthy of you m lemoine ” he said gently the frenchman smiled too “you’ve taken him on as your valet now haven’t you mr cade ” asked
superintendent battle “battle i take off my hat to you you know everything but just as a
matter of detail he’s taken me on not i him ”
“why was that i wonder mr cade ”
“i don’t know ” said anthony lightly “it’s a curious taste but
perhaps he may have liked my face or he may think i murdered his
master and wish to establish himself in a handy position for executing
revenge upon me ”
he rose and went over to the windows pulling the curtains “daylight ” he said with a slight yawn “there won’t be any more
excitements now ”
lemoine rose also “i will leave you ” he said “we shall perhaps meet again later in the
day ”
with a graceful bow to virginia he stepped out of the window “bed ” said virginia yawning “it’s all been very exciting come on bill go to bed like a good little boy the breakfast table will see us
not i fear ”
anthony stayed at the window looking after the retreating form of m lemoine “you wouldn’t think it ” said battle behind him “but that’s supposed
to be the cleverest detective in france ”
“i don’t know that i wouldn’t ” said anthony thoughtfully “i rather
think i would ”
“well ” said battle “he was right about the excitements of this night
being over by the way do you remember my telling you about that man
they’d found shot near staines ”
“yes why ”
“nothing they’ve identified him that’s all it seems he was called
giuseppe manelli he was a waiter at the blitz in london curious isn’t it ”"
Chapter 20,"20
battle and anthony confer
anthony said nothing he continued to stare out of the window superintendent battle looked for some time at his motionless back “well good night sir ” he said at last and moved to the door anthony stirred “wait a minute battle ”
the superintendent halted obediently anthony left the window he drew
out a cigarette from his case and lighted it then between two puffs
of smoke he said:
“you seem very interested in this business at staines ”
“i wouldn’t go as far as that sir it’s unusual that’s all ”
“do you think the man was shot where he was found or do you think
he was killed elsewhere and the body brought to that particular spot
afterwards ”
“i think he was shot somewhere else and the body brought there in a
car ”
“i think so too ” said anthony something in the emphasis of his tone made the detective look up
sharply “any ideas of your own sir do you know who brought him there ”
“yes ” said anthony “i did ”
he was a little annoyed at the absolutely unruffled calm preserved by
the other “i must say you take these shocks very well battle ” he remarked “‘never display emotion ’ that was a rule that was given to me once and i’ve found it very useful ”
“you live up to it certainly ” said anthony “i can’t say i’ve ever
seen you ruffled well do you want to hear the whole story ”
“if you please mr cade ”
anthony pulled up two of the chairs both men sat down and anthony
recounted the events of the preceding thursday night battle listened immovably there was a far-off twinkle in his eyes as
anthony finished “you know sir ” he said “you’ll get into trouble one of these days ”
“then for the second time i’m not to be taken into custody ”
“we always like to give a man plenty of rope ” said superintendent
battle “very delicately put ” said anthony “without unduly stressing the end
of the proverb ”
“what i can’t quite make out sir ” said battle “is why you decided to
come across with this now ”
“it’s rather difficult to explain ” said anthony “you see battle i’ve come to have really a very high opinion of your abilities when
the moment comes you’re always there look at to-night and it
occurred to me that in withholding this knowledge of mine i was
seriously cramping your style you deserve to have access to all the
facts i’ve done what i could and up to now i’ve made a mess of
things until to-night i couldn’t speak for mrs revel’s sake but now
that those letters have been definitely proved to have nothing whatever
to do with her any idea of her complicity becomes absurd perhaps
i advised her badly in the first place but it struck me that her
statement of having paid this man money to suppress the letters simply
as a whim might take a bit of believing ”
“it might by a jury ” agreed battle “juries never have any
imagination ”
“but you accept it quite easily ” said anthony looking curiously at
him “well you see mr cade most of my work has lain amongst these
people what they call the upper classes i mean you see the majority
of people are always wondering what the neighbours will think but
tramps and aristocrats don’t—they just do the first thing that comes
into their heads and they don’t bother to think what anyone thinks
of them i’m not meaning just the idle rich the people who give big
parties and so on i mean those that have had it born and bred in
them for generations that nobody else’s opinion counts but their own i’ve always found the upper classes the same—fearless truthful and
sometimes extraordinarily foolish ”
“this is a very interesting lecture battle i suppose you’ll be
writing your reminiscences one of these days they ought to be worth
reading too ”
the detective acknowledged the suggestion with a smile but said
nothing “i’d rather like to ask you one question ” continued anthony “did you
connect me at all with the staines affair i fancied from your manner that you did ”
“quite right i had a hunch that way but nothing definite to go upon your manner was very good if i may say so mr cade you never overdid
the carelessness ”
“i’m glad of that ” said anthony “i’ve a feeling that ever since i met
you you’ve been laying little traps for me on the whole i’ve managed
to avoid falling into them but the strain has been acute ”
battle smiled grimly “that’s how you get a crook in the end sir keep him on the run to
and fro turning and twisting sooner or later his nerve goes and
you’ve got him ”
“you’re a cheerful fellow battle when will you get me i wonder ”
“plenty of rope sir ” quoted the superintendent “plenty of rope ”
“in the meantime ” said anthony “i am still the amateur assistant ”
“that’s it mr cade ”
“watson to your sherlock in fact ”
“detective stories are mostly bunkum ” said battle unemotionally “but
they amuse people ” he added as an afterthought “and they’re useful
sometimes ”
“in what way ” asked anthony curiously “they encourage the universal idea that the police are stupid when we
get an amateur crime such as a murder that’s very useful indeed ”
anthony looked at him for some minutes in silence battle sat quite
still blinking now and then with no expression whatsoever on his
square placid face presently he rose “not much good going to bed now ” he observed “as soon as he’s up i
want to have a few words with his lordship anyone who wants to leave
the house can do so now at the same time i should be much obliged to
his lordship if he’ll extend an informal invitation to his guests to
stay on you’ll accept it sir if you please and mrs revel also ”
“have you ever found the revolver ” asked anthony suddenly “you mean the one prince michael was shot with no i haven’t yet
it must be in the house or grounds i’ll take a hint from you mr cade and send some boys up bird’s-nesting if i could get hold of the
revolver we might get forward a bit that and the bundle of letters you say that a letter with the heading chimneys was amongst them depend upon it that was the last one written the instructions for
finding the diamond are written in code in that letter ”
“what’s your theory of the killing of giuseppe ” asked anthony “i should say he was a regular thief and that he was got hold of either by king victor or by the comrades of the red hand and employed
by them i shouldn’t wonder at all if the comrades and king victor
aren’t working together the organization has plenty of money and
power but it isn’t very strong in brains giuseppe’s task was to steal
the memoirs—they couldn’t have known that you had the letters—it’s a
very odd coincidence that you should have by the way ”
“i know ” said anthony “it’s amazing when you come to think of it ”
“giuseppe gets hold of the letters instead is at first vastly
chagrined then sees the cutting from the paper and has the brilliant
idea of turning them to account on his own by blackmailing the lady he
has of course no idea of their real significance the comrades find
out what he is doing believe that he is deliberately double crossing
them and decree his death they’re very fond of executing traitors it has a picturesque element which seems to appeal to them what i
can’t quite make out is the revolver with ‘virginia’ engraved upon it there’s too much finesse about that for the comrades as a rule they
enjoy plastering their red hand sign about—in order to strike terror
into other would-be traitors no it looks to me as though king victor
had stepped in there but what his motive was i don’t know it looks
like a very deliberate attempt to saddle mrs revel with the murder and on the surface there doesn’t seem any particular point in that ”
“i had a theory ” said anthony “but it didn’t work out according to
plan ”
he told battle of virginia’s recognition of michael battle nodded his
head “oh yes no doubt as to his identity by the way that old baron has a
very high opinion of you he speaks of you in most enthusiastic terms ”
“that’s very kind of him ” said anthony “especially as i’ve given him
full warning that i mean to do my utmost to get hold of the missing
memoirs before wednesday next ”
“you’ll have a job to do that ” said battle “y—es you think so i suppose king victor and co have got the
letters ”
battle nodded “pinched them off giuseppe that day in pont street prettily planned
piece of work that yes they’ve got ’em all right and they’ve
decoded them and they know where to look ”
both men were on the point of passing out of the room “in here ” said anthony jerking his head back “exactly in here but they haven’t found the prize yet and they’re
going to run a pretty risk trying to get it ”
“i suppose ” said anthony “that you’ve got a plan in that subtle head
of yours ”
battle returned no answer he looked particularly stolid and
unintelligent then very slowly he winked “want my help ” asked anthony “i do and i shall want some one else’s ”
“who is that ”
“mrs revel’s you may not have noticed it mr cade but she’s a lady
who has a particularly beguiling way with her ”
“i’ve noticed it all right ” said anthony he glanced at his watch “i’m inclined to agree with you about bed battle a dip in the lake
and a hearty breakfast will be far more to the point ”
he ran lightly upstairs to his bedroom whistling to himself he
discarded his evening clothes and picked up a dressing-gown and a bath
towel then suddenly he stopped dead in front of the dressing-table staring
at the object that reposed demurely in front of the looking-glass for a moment he could not believe his eyes he took it up examined it
closely yes there was no mistake it was the bundle of letters signed virginia revel they were intact not one was missing anthony dropped into a chair the letters in his hand “my brain must be cracking ” he murmured “i can’t understand a quarter
of what is going on in this house why should the letters reappear like
a damned conjuring trick who put them on my dressing-table why ”
and to all these very pertinent questions he could find no satisfactory
reply "
Chapter 21,"21
mr isaacstein’s suit-case
at ten o’clock that morning lord caterham and his daughter were
breakfasting bundle was looking very thoughtful “father ” she said at last lord caterham absorbed in _the times_ did not reply “father ” said bundle again more sharply lord caterham torn from his interested perusal of forthcoming sales of
rare books looked up absent-mindedly “eh ” he said “did you speak ”
“yes who is it who’s had breakfast ”
she nodded towards a place that had evidently been occupied the rest
were all expectant “oh what’s-his-name ”
“fat iky ”
bundle and her father had enough sympathy between them to comprehend
each other’s somewhat misleading observations “that’s it ”
“did i see you talking to the detective this morning before breakfast ”
lord caterham sighed “yes he buttonholed me in the hall i do think the hours before
breakfast should be sacred i shall have to go abroad the strain on my
nerves——”
bundle interrupted unceremoniously “what did he say ”
“said every one who wanted to could clear out ”
“well ” said bundle “that’s all right that’s what you’ve been
wanting ”
“i know but he didn’t leave it at that he went on to say that
nevertheless he wanted me to ask every one to stay on ”
“i don’t understand ” said bundle wrinkling her nose “so confusing and contradictory ” complained lord caterham “and before
breakfast too ”
“what did you say ”
“oh i agreed of course it’s never any good arguing with these
people especially before breakfast ” continued lord caterham reverting to his principal grievance “who have you asked so far ”
“cade he was up very early this morning he’s going to stop on i
don’t mind that i can’t quite make the fellow out; but i like him—i
like him very much ”
“so does virginia ” said bundle drawing a pattern on the table with
her fork “eh ”
“and so do i but that doesn’t seem to matter ”
“and i asked isaacstein ” continued lord caterham “well ”
“but fortunately he’s got to go back to town don’t forget to order the
car for the 10 40 by the way ”
“all right ”
“now if i can only get rid of fish too ” continued lord caterham his
spirits rising “i thought you liked talking to him about your mouldy old books ”
“so i do so i do so i did rather but it gets monotonous when
one finds that one is always doing all the talking fish is very
interested but he never volunteers any statements of his own ”
“it’s better than doing all the listening ” said bundle “like one does
with george lomax ”
lord caterham shuddered at the remembrance “george is all very well on platforms ” said bundle “i’ve clapped
him myself though of course i know all the time that he’s talking
balderdash and anyway i’m a socialist——”
“i know my dear i know ” said lord caterham hastily “it’s all right ” said bundle “i’m not going to bring politics into
the house that’s what george does—public speaking in private life it
ought to be abolished by act of parliament ”
“quite so ” said lord caterham “what about virginia ” asked bundle “is she to be asked to stop on ”
“battle said everybody ”
“says he firmly have you asked her to be my stepma yet ”
“i don’t think it would be any good ” said lord caterham mournfully “although she did call me a darling last night but that’s the worst of
these attractive young women with affectionate dispositions they’ll
say anything and they mean absolutely nothing by it ”
“no ” agreed bundle “it would have been much more hopeful if she’d
thrown a boot at you or tried to bite you ”
“you modern young people seem to have such unpleasant ideas about
love-making ” said lord caterham plaintively “it comes from reading _the sheik_ ” said bundle “desert love throw
her about etc ”
“what is _the sheik_ ” asked lord caterham simply “is it a poem ”
bundle looked at him with commiserating pity then she rose and kissed
the top of his head “dear old daddy ” she remarked and sprang lightly out of the window lord caterham went back to the sale rooms he jumped when addressed suddenly by mr hiram fish who had made his
usual noiseless entry “good morning lord caterham ”
“oh good morning ” said lord caterham “good morning nice day ”
“the weather is delightful ” said mr fish he helped himself to coffee by way of food he took a piece of dry
toast “do i hear correctly that the embargo is removed ” he asked after a
minute or two “that we are all free to depart ”
“yes—er—yes ” said lord caterham “as a matter of fact i hoped i
mean that i shall be delighted”—his conscience drove him on—“only too
delighted if you will stay on for a little ”
“why lord caterham——”
“it’s been a beastly visit i know ” lord caterham hurried on “too
bad shan’t blame you for wanting to run away ”
“you misjudge me lord caterham the associations have been painful no one could deny that point but the english country life as lived
in the mansions of the great has a powerful attraction for me i am
interested in the study of those conditions it is a thing we lack
completely in america i shall be only too delighted to accept your
vurry kind invitation and stay on ”
“oh well ” said lord caterham “that’s that absolutely delighted my
dear fellow absolutely delighted ”
spurring himself on to a false geniality of manner lord caterham
murmured something about having to see his bailiff and escaped from the
room in the hall he saw virginia just descending the staircase “shall i take you into breakfast ” asked lord caterham tenderly “i’ve had it in bed thank you i was frightfully sleepy this morning ”
she yawned “had a bad night perhaps ”
“not exactly a bad night from one point of view decidedly a good
night oh lord caterham”—she slipped her hand inside his arm and
gave it a squeeze—“i _am_ enjoying myself you were a darling to ask
me down ”
“you’ll stop on for a bit then won’t you battle is lifting the—the
embargo but i want you to stay particularly so does bundle ”
“of course i’ll stay it’s sweet of you to ask me ”
“ah ” said lord caterham he sighed “what is your secret sorrow ” asked virginia “has anyone bitten you ”
“that’s just it ” said lord caterham mournfully virginia looked puzzled “you don’t feel by any chance that you want to throw a boot at me no i can see you don’t oh well it’s of no consequence ”
lord caterham drifted sadly away and virginia passed out through a
side door into the garden she stood there for a moment breathing in the crisp october air which
was infinitely refreshing to one in her slightly jaded state she started a little to find superintendent battle at her elbow the
man seemed to have an extraordinary knack of appearing out of space
without the least warning “good morning mrs revel not too tired i hope ”
virginia shook her head “it was a most exciting night ” she said “well worth the loss of a
little sleep the only thing is to-day seems a little dull after it ”
“there’s a nice shady place down under that cedar tree ” remarked the
superintendent “shall i take a chair down to it for you ”
“if you think it’s the best thing for me to do ” said virginia solemnly “you’re very quick mrs revel yes it’s quite true i do want a word
with you ”
he picked up a long wicker chair and carried it down the lawn virginia
followed him with a cushion under her arm “very dangerous place that terrace ” remarked the detective “that is if you want to have a private conversation ”
“i’m getting excited again superintendent battle ”
“oh it’s nothing important ” he took out a big watch and glanced at
it “half-past ten i’m starting for wyvvern abbey in ten minutes to
report to mr lomax plenty of time i only wanted to know if you could
tell me a little more about mr cade ”
“about mr cade ”
virginia was startled “yes where you first met him and how long you’ve known him and so
forth ”
battle’s manner was easy and pleasant enough he even refrained from
looking at her and the fact that he did so made her vaguely uneasy “it’s more difficult than you think ” she said at last “he did me a
great service once——”
battle interrupted her “before you go any further mrs revel i’d just like to say something last night after you and mr eversleigh had gone to bed mr cade told
me all about the letters and the man who was killed in your house ”
“he did ” gasped virginia “yes and very wisely too it clears up a lot of misunderstanding there’s only one thing he didn’t tell me—how long he had known you now i’ve a little idea of my own about that you shall tell me if i’m
right or wrong i think that the day he came to your house in pont
street was the first time you had ever seen him ah i see i’m right it was so ”
virginia said nothing for the first time she felt afraid of this
stolid man with the expressionless face she understood what anthony
had meant when he said there were no flies on superintendent battle “has he ever told you anything about his life ” the detective
continued “before he was in south africa i mean canada or before
that the sudan or about his boyhood ”
virginia merely shook her head “and yet i’d bet he’s got something worth telling you can’t mistake
the face of a man who’s led a life of daring and adventure he could
tell you some interesting tales if he cared to ”
“if you want to know about his past life why don’t you cable to that
friend of his mr mcgrath ” virginia asked “oh we have but it seems he’s up country somewhere still there’s no
doubt mr cade was in bulawayo when he said he was but i wondered what
he’d been doing before he came to south africa he’d only had that job
with castle’s about a month ” he took out his watch again “i must be
off the car will be waiting ”
virginia watched him retreat to the house but she did not move from
her chair she hoped that anthony might appear and join her instead
came bill eversleigh with a prodigious yawn “thank god i’ve got a chance to speak to you at last virginia ” he
complained “well speak to me very gently bill darling or i shall burst into
tears ”
“has some one been bullying you ”
“not exactly bullying me getting inside my mind and turning it inside
out i feel as though i’d been jumped on by an elephant ”
“not battle ”
“yes battle he’s a terrible man really ”
“well never mind battle i say virginia i do love you so awfully——”
“not this morning bill i’m not strong enough anyway i’ve always
told you the best people don’t propose before lunch ”
“good lord ” said bill “i could propose to you before breakfast ”
virginia shuddered “bill be sensible and intelligent for a minute i want to ask your
advice ”
“if you’d once make up your mind to it and say you’d marry me you’d
feel miles better i’m sure happier you know and more settled down ”
“listen to me bill proposing to me is your _idée fixe_ all men
propose when they’re bored and can’t think of anything to say remember
my age and my widowed state and go and make love to a pure young girl ”
“my darling virginia—oh blast here’s that french idiot bearing down
on us ”
it was indeed m lemoine black-bearded and correct of demeanour as
ever “good morning madame you are not fatigued i trust ”
“not in the least ”
“that is excellent good morning mr eversleigh ”
“how would it be if we promenaded ourselves a little the three of us ”
suggested the frenchman “how about it bill ” said virginia “oh all right ” said the unwilling young gentleman by her side he heaved himself up from the grass and the three of them walked
slowly along virginia between the two men she was sensible at once of
a strange undercurrent of excitement in the frenchman though she had
no clue as to what caused it soon with her usual skill she was putting him at his ease asking him
questions listening to his answers and gradually drawing him out presently he was telling them anecdotes of the famous king victor he
talked well albeit with a certain bitterness as he described the
various ways in which the detective bureau had been outwitted but all the time despite the real absorption of lemoine in his own
narrative virginia had a feeling that he had some other object in
view moreover she judged that lemoine under cover of his story was
deliberately striking out his own course across the park they were
not just strolling idly he was deliberately guiding them in a certain
direction suddenly he broke off his story and looked round they were
standing just where the drive intersected the park before turning an
abrupt corner by a clump of trees lemoine was staring at a vehicle
approaching them from the direction of the house virginia’s eyes followed his “it’s the luggage cart ” she said “taking isaacstein’s luggage and his
valet to the station ”
“is that so ” said lemoine he glanced down at his own watch and
started “a thousand pardons i have been longer here than i
meant—such charming company is it possible do you think that i
might have a lift to the village ”
he stepped out on to the drive and signalled with his arm the luggage
cart stopped and after a word or two of explanation lemoine climbed in
behind he raised his hat politely to virginia and drove off the other two stood and watched the cart disappearing with puzzled
expressions just as the cart swung round the bend a suit-case fell
off into the drive the cart went on “come on ” said virginia to bill “we’re going to see something
interesting that suit-case was thrown out ”
“nobody’s noticed it ” said bill they ran down the drive towards the fallen piece of luggage just as
they reached it lemoine came round the corner of the bend on foot he
was hot from walking fast “i was obliged to descend ” he said pleasantly “i found that i had
left something behind ”
“this ” said bill indicating the suit-case it was a handsome case of heavy pigskin with the initials h i on it “what a pity ” said lemoine gently “it must have fallen out shall we
lift it from the road ”
without waiting for a reply he picked up the suit-case and carried it
over to the belt of trees he stooped over it something flashed in his
hand and the lock slipped back he spoke and his voice was totally different quick and commanding “the car will be here in a minute ” he said “is it in sight ”
virginia looked back towards the house “no ”
“good ”
with deft fingers he tossed the things out of the suit-case gold-topped bottle silk pyjamas a variety of socks suddenly his
whole figure stiffened he caught up what appeared to be a bundle of
silk underwear and unrolled it rapidly a slight exclamation broke from bill in the centre of the bundle was a
heavy revolver “i hear the horn ” said virginia like lightning lemoine repacked the suit-case the revolver he wrapped
in a silk handkerchief of his own and slipped into his pocket he
snapped the locks of the suit-case and turned quickly to bill “take it madame will be with you stop the car and explain that it
fell off the luggage cart do not mention me ”
bill stepped quickly down to the drive just as the big lanchester
limousine with isaacstein inside it came round the corner the
chauffeur slowed down and bill swung the suit-case up to him “fell off the luggage cart ” he explained “we happened to see it ”
he caught a momentary glimpse of a startled yellow face as the
financier stared at him and then the car swept on again they went back to lemoine he was standing with the revolver in his
hand and a look of gloating satisfaction in his face “a long shot ” he said “a very long shot but it came off ”"
Chapter 22,"22
the red signal
superintendent battle was standing in the library at wyvvern abbey george lomax seated before a desk overflowing with papers was
frowning portentously superintendent battle had opened proceedings by making a brief and
business-like report since then the conversation had lain almost
entirely with george and battle had contented himself with making
brief and usually monosyllabic replies to the other’s questions on the desk in front of george was the packet of letters anthony had
found on his dressing-table “i can’t understand it at all ” said george irritably as he picked up
the packet “they’re in code you say ”
“just so mr lomax ”
“and where does he say he found them—on his dressing-table ”
battle repeated word for word anthony cade’s account of how he had
come to regain possession of the letters “and he brought them at once to you that was quite proper—quite
proper but who could have placed them in his room ”
battle shook his head “that’s the sort of thing you ought to know ” complained george “it
sounds to me very fishy—very fishy indeed what do we know about this
man cade anyway he appears in a most mysterious manner—under highly
suspicious circumstances—and we know nothing whatever about him i
may say that i personally don’t care for his manner at all you’ve
made inquiries about him i suppose ”
superintendent battle permitted himself a patient smile “we wired at once to south africa and his story has been confirmed on
all points he was in bulawayo with mr mcgrath at the time he stated previous to their meeting he was employed by messrs castle the
tourist agents ”
“just what i should have expected ” said george “he has the kind of
cheap assurance that succeeds in a certain type of employment but
about these letters—steps must be taken at once—at once——”
the great man puffed himself out and swelled importantly superintendent battle opened his mouth but george forestalled him “there must be no delay these letters must be decoded without any loss
of time let me see who is the man there is a man—connected with
the british museum knows all there is to know about ciphers ran the
department for us during the war where is miss oscar she will know name something like win—win——”
“professor wynward ” said battle “exactly i remember perfectly now he must be wired to immediately ”
“i have done so mr lomax an hour ago he will arrive by the 12 10 ”
“oh very good very good thank heaven something is off my mind i shall have to be in town to-day you can get along without me i
suppose ”
“i think so sir ”
“well do your best battle do your best i am terribly rushed just at
present ”
“just so sir ”
“by the way why did not mr eversleigh come over with you ”
“he was still asleep sir we’ve been up all night as i told you ”
“oh quite so i am frequently up nearly the whole night myself to do
the work of thirty-six hours in twenty-four that is my constant task send mr eversleigh over at once when you get back will you battle ”
“i will give him your message sir ”
“thank you battle i realize perfectly that you had to repose a
certain amount of confidence in him but do you think it was strictly
necessary to take my cousin mrs revel into your confidence also ”
“in view of the name signed to those letters i do mr lomax ”
“an amazing piece of effrontery ” murmured george his brow darkened
as he looked at the bundle of letters “i remember the late king of
herzoslovakia a charming fellow but weak—deplorably weak a tool in
the hands of an unscrupulous woman have you any theory as to how these
letters came to be restored to mr cade ”
“it’s my opinion ” said battle “that if people can’t get a thing one
way—they try another ”
“i don’t quite follow you ” said george “this crook this king victor he’s well aware by now that the council
chamber is watched so he’ll let us have the letters and let us do
the decoding and let us find the hiding-place and then—trouble but
lemoine and i between us will attend to that ”
“you’ve got a plan eh ”
“i wouldn’t go so far as to say i’ve got a plan but i’ve got an idea it’s a very useful thing sometimes an idea ”
thereupon superintendent battle took his departure he had no intention of taking george any further into his confidence on the way back he passed anthony on the road and stopped “going to give me a lift back to the house ” asked anthony “that’s
good ”
“where have you been mr cade ”
“down to the station to inquire about trains ”
battle raised his eyebrows “thinking of leaving us again ” he inquired “not just at present ” laughed anthony “by the way what’s upset
isaacstein he arrived in the car just as i left and he looked as
though something had given him a nasty jolt ”
“mr isaacstein ”
“yes ”
“i can’t say i’m sure i fancy it would take a good deal to jolt him ”
“so do i ” agreed anthony “he’s quite one of the strong silent yellow
men of finance ”
suddenly battle leant forward and touched the chauffeur on the shoulder “stop will you and wait for me here ”
he jumped out of the car much to anthony’s surprise but in a minute
or two the latter perceived m lemoine advancing to meet the english
detective and gathered that it was a signal from him which had
attracted battle’s attention there was a rapid colloquy between them and then the superintendent
returned to the car and jumped in again biding the chauffeur drive on his expression had completely changed “they’ve found the revolver ” he said suddenly and curtly “what ”
anthony gazed at him in great surprise “where ”
“in isaacstein’s suit-case ”
“oh impossible ”
“nothing’s impossible ” said battle “i ought to have remembered that ”
he sat perfectly still tapping his knee with his hand “who found it ”
battle jerked his head over his shoulder “lemoine clever chap they think no end of him at the sûreté ”
“but doesn’t this upset all your ideas ”
“no ” said superintendent battle very slowly “i can’t say it does it
was a bit of a surprise i admit at first but it fits in very well
with one idea of mine ”
“which is ”
but the superintendent branched off on to a totally different subject “i wonder if you’d mind finding mr eversleigh for me sir there’s a
message for him from mr lomax he’s to go over to the abbey at once ”
“all right ” said anthony the car had just drawn up at the great door “he’s probably in bed still ”
“i think not ” said the detective “if you’ll look you’ll see him
walking under the trees with mrs revel ”
“wonderful eyes you have haven’t you battle ” said anthony as he
departed on his errand he delivered the message to bill who was duly disgusted “damn it all ” grumbled bill to himself as he strode off to the house “why can’t codders sometimes leave me alone and why can’t these
blasted colonials stay in their colonies what do they want to come
over here for and pick out all the best girls i’m fed to the teeth
with everything ”
“have you heard about the revolver ” asked virginia breathlessly as
bill left them “battle told me rather staggering isn’t it isaacstein was in a
frightful state yesterday to get away but i thought it was just
nerves he’s about the one person i’d have pitched upon as being above
suspicion can you see any motive for his wanting prince michael out of
the way ”
“it certainly doesn’t fit in ” agreed virginia thoughtfully “nothing fits in anywhere ” said anthony discontentedly “i rather
fancied myself as an amateur detective to begin with and so far all
i’ve done is to clear the character of the french governess at vast
trouble and some little expense ”
“is that what you went to france for ” inquired virginia “yes i went to dinard and had an interview with the comtesse de
breteuil awfully pleased with my own cleverness and fully expecting
to be told that no such person as mademoiselle brun had ever been
heard of instead of which i was given to understand that the lady in
question had been the mainstay of the household for the last seven
years so unless the comtesse is also a crook that ingenious theory
of mine falls to the ground ”
virginia shook her head “madame de breteuil is quite above suspicion i know her quite well and i fancy i must have come across mademoiselle at the chateau i
certainly know her face quite well—in that vague way one does know
governesses and companions and people one sits opposite to in trains it’s awful but i never really look at them properly do you ”
“only if they’re exceptionally beautiful ” admitted anthony “well in this case——” she broke off “what’s the matter ”
anthony was staring at a figure which detached itself from the clump of
trees and stood there rigidly at attention it was the herzoslovakian boris “excuse me ” said anthony to virginia “i must just speak to my dog a
minute ”
he went across to where boris was standing “what’s the matter what do you want ”
“master ” said boris bowing “yes that’s all very well but you mustn’t keep following me about
like this it looks odd ”
without a word boris produced a soiled scrap of paper evidently torn
from a letter and handed it to anthony “what’s this ” said anthony there was an address scrawled on the paper nothing else “he dropped it ” said boris “i bring it to the master ”
“who dropped it ”
“the foreign gentleman ”
“but why bring it to me ”
boris looked at him reproachfully “well anyway go away now ” said anthony “i’m busy ”
boris saluted turned sharply on his heel and marched away anthony
rejoined virginia thrusting the piece of paper into his pocket “what did he want ” she asked curiously “and why do you call him your
dog ”
“because he acts like one ” said anthony answering the last question
first “he must have been a retriever in his last incarnation i think he’s just brought me a piece of a letter which he says the foreign
gentleman dropped i suppose he means lemoine ”
“i suppose so ” acquiesced virginia “he’s always following me round ” continued anthony “just like a dog says next to nothing just looks at me with his big round eyes i can’t
make him out ”
“perhaps he meant isaacstein ” suggested virginia “isaacstein looks
foreign enough heaven knows ”
“isaacstein ” muttered anthony impatiently “where the devil does he
come in ”
“are you ever sorry that you’ve mixed yourself up in all this ” asked
virginia suddenly “sorry good lord no i love it i’ve spent most of my life looking
for trouble you know perhaps this time i’ve got a little more than
i bargained for ”
“but you’re well out of the wood now ” said virginia a little
surprised by the unusual gravity of his tone “not quite ”
they strolled on for a minute or two in silence “there are some people ” said anthony breaking the silence “who
don’t conform to the signals an ordinary well-regulated locomotive
slows down or pulls up when it sees the red light hoisted against it perhaps i was born colour blind when i see the red signal—i can’t
help forging ahead and in the end you know that spells disaster bound to and quite right really that sort of thing is bad for traffic
generally ”
he still spoke very seriously “i suppose ” said virginia “that you have taken a good many risks in
your life ”
“pretty nearly every one there is—except marriage ”
“that’s rather cynical ”
“it wasn’t meant to be marriage the kind of marriage i mean would be
the biggest adventure of the lot ”
“i like that ” said virginia flushing eagerly “there’s only one kind of woman i’d want to marry—the kind who is
worlds removed from my type of life what would we do about it is she
to lead my life or am i to lead hers ”
“if she loved you——”
“sentimentality mrs revel you know it is love isn’t a drug that
you take to blind you to your surroundings—you can make it that yes but it’s a pity—love can be a lot more than that what do you think
the king and his beggar maid thought of married life after they’d been
married a year or two didn’t she regret her rags and her bare feet
and her care-free life you bet she did would it have been any good
renouncing his crown for her sake not a bit of good either he’d have
made a damned bad beggar i’m sure and no woman respects a man when
he’s doing a thing thoroughly badly ”
“have you fallen in love with a beggar maid mr cade ” inquired
virginia softly “it’s the other way about with me but the principle’s the same ”
“and there’s no way out ” asked virginia “there’s always a way out ” said anthony gloomily “i’ve a theory that
one can always get anything one wants if one will pay the price and
do you know what the price is nine times out of ten compromise a
beastly thing compromise but it steals upon you as you near middle
age it’s stealing upon me now to get the woman i want i’d—i’d even
take up regular work ”
virginia laughed “i was brought up to a trade you know ” continued anthony “and you abandoned it ”
“yes ”
“why ”
“a matter of principle ”
“oh ”
“you’re a very unusual woman ” said anthony suddenly turning and
looking at her “why ”
“you can refrain from asking questions ”
“you mean that i haven’t asked you what your trade was ”
“just that ”
again they walked on in silence they were nearing the house now passing close by the scented sweetness of the rose garden “you understand well enough i dare say ” said anthony breaking the
silence “you know when a man’s in love with you i don’t suppose you
care a hang for me—or for anyone else—but by god i’d like to make
you care ”
“do you think you could ” asked virginia in a low voice “probably not but i’d have a damned good try ”
“are you sorry you ever met me ” she said suddenly “lord no it’s the red signal again when i first saw you—that day
in pont street i knew i was up against something that was going to
hurt like fun your face did that to me—just your face there’s magic
in you from head to foot—some women are like that but i’ve never
known a woman who had so much of it as you have you’ll marry some
one respectable and prosperous i suppose and i shall return to my
disreputable life but i’ll kiss you once before i go—i swear i will ”
“you can’t do it now ” said virginia softly “superintendent battle is
watching us out of the library window ”
anthony looked at her “you’re rather a devil virginia ” he said dispassionately “but rather
a dear too ”
then he waved his hand airily to superintendent battle “caught any criminals this morning battle ”
“not as yet mr cade ”
“that sounds hopeful ”
battle with an agility surprising in so stolid a man vaulted out of
the library window and joined them on the terrace “i’ve got professor wynward down here ” he announced in a whisper “just this minute arrived he’s decoding the letters now would you
like to see him at work ”
his tone suggested that of the showman speaking of some pet exhibit receiving a reply in the affirmative he led them up to the window and
invited them to peep inside seated at a table the letters spread out in front of him and writing
busily on a big sheet of paper was a small red-haired man of middle
age he grunted irritably to himself as he wrote and every now and
then rubbed his nose violently until its hue almost rivalled that of
his hair presently he looked up “that you battle what you want me down here to unravel this
tomfoolery for a child in arms could do it a baby of two could do it
on its head call this thing a cipher it leaps to the eye man ”
“i’m glad of that professor ” said battle mildly “but we’re not all
so clever as you are you know ”
“it doesn’t need cleverness ” snapped the professor “it’s routine
work do you want the whole bundle done it’s a long business you
know—requires diligent application and close attention and absolutely
no intelligence i’ve done the one dated ‘chimneys’ which you said was
important i might as well take the rest back to london and hand ’em
over to one of my assistants i really can’t afford the time myself i’ve come away now from a real teaser and i want to get back to it ”
his eyes glistened a little “very well professor ” assented battle “i’m sorry we’re such small
fry i’ll explain to mr lomax it’s just this one letter that all the
hurry is about lord caterham is expecting you to stay for lunch i
believe ”
“never have lunch ” said the professor “bad habit lunch a banana
and a water biscuit is all any sane and healthy man should need in the
middle of the day ”
he seized his overcoat which lay across the back of a chair battle
went round to the front of the house and a few minutes later anthony
and virginia heard the sound of a car driving away battle rejoined them carrying in his hand the half-sheet of paper
which the professor had given him “he’s always like that ” said battle referring to the departed
professor “in the very deuce of a hurry clever man though well here’s the kernel of her majesty’s letter care to have a look at it ”
virginia stretched out a hand and anthony read it over her shoulder it had been he remembered a long epistle breathing mingled passion
and despair the genius of professor wynward had transformed it into an
essentially business-like communication _operations carried out successfully but s double crossed us has
removed stone from hiding-place not in his room i have searched found following memorandum which i think refers to it_: “richmond seven
straight eight left three right ”
“s ” said anthony “stylptitch of course cunning old dog he changed
the hiding-place ”
“richmond ” said virginia thoughtfully “is the diamond concealed
somewhere at richmond i wonder ”
“it’s a favourite spot for royalties ” agreed anthony battle shook his head “i still think it’s a reference to something in this house ”
“i know ” cried virginia suddenly both men turned to look at her “the holbein portrait in the council chamber they were tapping on the
wall just below it and it’s a portrait of the earl of richmond ”
“you’ve got it ” said battle and slapped his leg he spoke with an animation quite unwonted “that’s the starting-point the picture and the crooks know no more
than we do what the figures refer to those two men in armour stand
directly underneath the picture and their first idea was that the
diamond was hidden in one of them the measurements might have been
inches that failed and their next idea was a secret passage or
stairway or a sliding panel do you know of any such thing mrs revel ”
virginia shook her head “there’s a priest’s hole and at least one secret passage i know ” she
said “i believe i’ve been shown them once but i can’t remember much
about them now here’s bundle she’ll know ”
bundle was coming quickly along the terrace towards them “i’m taking the panhard up to town after lunch ” she remarked “anyone
want a lift wouldn’t you like to come mr cade we’ll be back by
dinner-time ”
“no thanks ” said anthony “i’m quite happy and busy down here ”
“the man fears me ” said bundle “either my driving or my fatal
fascination which is it ”
“the latter ” said anthony “every time ”
“bundle dear ” said virginia “is there any secret passage leading out
of the council chamber ”
“rather but it’s only a mouldy one supposed to lead from chimneys to
wyvvern abbey so it did in the old old days but it’s all blocked up
now you can only get along it for about a hundred yards from this end the one upstairs in the white gallery is ever so much more amusing and
the priest’s hole isn’t half bad ”
“we’re not regarding them from an artistic standpoint ” explained
virginia “it’s business how do you get into the council chamber one ”
“hinged panel i’ll show you after lunch if you like ”
“thank you ” said superintendent battle “shall we say at 2 30 ”
bundle looked at him with lifted eyebrows “crook stuff ” she inquired tredwell appeared on the terrace “luncheon is served my lady ” he announced "
Chapter 23,"23
encounter in the rose garden
at 2 30 a little party met together in the council chamber: bundle virginia superintendent battle m lemoine and anthony cade “no good waiting until we can get hold of mr lomax ” said battle “this is the kind of business one wants to get on with quickly ”
“if you’ve got any idea that prince michael was murdered by some one
who got in this way you’re wrong ” said bundle “it can’t be done the
other end’s blocked completely ”
“there is no question of that milady ” said lemoine quickly “it is
quite a different search that we make ”
“looking for something are you ” asked bundle quickly “not the
historic what-not by any chance ”
lemoine looked puzzled “explain yourself bundle ” said virginia encouragingly “you can when
you try ”
“the thingummybob ” said bundle “the historic diamond of purple
princes that was pinched in the dark ages before i grew to years of
discretion ”
“who told you this lady eileen ” asked battle “i’ve always known one of the footmen told me when i was twelve years
old ”
“a footman ” said battle “lord i’d like mr lomax to have heard that ”
“is it one of george’s closely guarded secrets ” asked bundle “how
perfectly screaming i never really thought it was true george always
was an ass—he must know that servants always know everything ”
she went across to the holbein portrait touched a spring concealed
somewhere at the side of it and immediately with a creaking noise a
section of the panelling swung inward revealing a dark opening “entrez messieurs et mesdames ” said bundle dramatically “walk up walk up dearies best show of the season and only a tanner ”
both lemoine and battle were provided with torches they entered the
dark aperture first the others close on their heels “air’s nice and fresh ” remarked battle “must be ventilated somehow ”
he walked on ahead the floor was of rough uneven stone but the
walls were bricked as bundle had said the passage extended for a
bare hundred yards then it came to an abrupt end with a fallen heap
of masonry battle satisfied himself that there was no way of egress
beyond and then spoke over his shoulder “we’ll go back if you please i wanted just to spy out the land so to
speak ”
in a few minutes they were back again at the panelled entrance “we’ll start from here ” said battle “seven straight eight left three right take the first as paces ”
he paced seven steps carefully and bending down examined the ground “about right i should fancy at one time or another there’s been
a chalk mark made here now then eight left that’s not paces the
passage is only wide enough to go indian file anyway ”
“say it in bricks ” suggested anthony “quite right mr cade eight bricks from the bottom or the top on the
left-hand side try from the bottom first—it’s easier ”
he counted up eight bricks “now three to the right of that one two three—hullo—— hullo what’s this ”
“i shall scream in a minute ” said bundle “i know i shall _what_ is
it ”
superintendent battle was working at the brick with the point of his
knife his practised eye had quickly seen that this particular brick
was different from the rest a minute or two’s work and he was able to
pull it right out behind was a small dark cavity battle thrust in his
hand every one waited in breathless expectancy battle drew out his hand again he uttered an exclamation of surprise and anger the others crowded round and stared uncomprehendingly at the three
articles he held for a moment it seemed as though their eyes must have
deceived them a card of small pearl buttons a square of coarse knitting and a piece
of paper on which were inscribed a row of capital e’s “well ” said battle “i’m—i’m danged what’s the meaning of this ”
“_mon dieu_ ” muttered the frenchman “_ça c’est un peu trop fort _”
“but what does it mean ” cried virginia bewildered “mean ” said anthony “there’s only one thing it can mean the late
count stylptitch must have had a sense of humour this is an example
of that humour i may say that i don’t consider it particularly funny
myself ”
“do you mind explaining your meaning a little more clearly sir ” said
superintendent battle “certainly this was the count’s little joke he must have suspected
that his memorandum had been read when the crooks came to recover the
jewel they were to find instead this extremely clever conundrum it’s
the sort of thing you pin on to yourself at book teas when people have
to guess what you are ”
“it has a meaning then ”
“i should say undoubtedly if the count had meant to be merely
offensive he would have put a placard with ‘sold’ on it or a picture
of a donkey or something crude like that ”
“a bit of knitting some capital e’s and a lot of buttons ” muttered
battle discontentedly “_c’est inoui_ ” said lemoine angrily “cipher no 2 ” said anthony “i wonder whether professor wynward would
be any good at this one ”
“when was this passage last used milady ” asked the frenchman of
bundle bundle reflected “i don’t believe anyone’s been into it for over two years the priest’s
hole is the show exhibit for americans and tourists generally ”
“curious ” murmured the frenchman “why curious ”
lemoine stooped and picked up a small object from the floor “because of this ” he said “this match has not lain here for two
years—not even for two days ”
battle looked at the match curiously it was of pink wood with a
yellow head “any of you ladies or gentlemen drop this by any chance ” he asked he received a negative all round “well then ” said superintendent battle “we’ve seen all there is to
see we might as well get out of here ”
the proposal was assented to by all the panel had swung to but bundle
showed them how it was fastened from the inside she unlatched it swung it noiselessly open and sprang through the opening alighting in
the council chamber with a resounding thud “damn ” said lord caterham springing up from an arm-chair in which he
appeared to have been taking forty winks “poor old father ” said bundle “did i startle you ”
“i can’t think ” said lord caterham “why nobody nowadays ever sits
still after a meal it’s a lost art god knows chimneys is big enough but even here there doesn’t seem to be a single room where i can be
sure of a little peace good lord how many of you are there reminds
me of the pantomimes i used to go to as a boy when hordes of demons
used to pop up out of trapdoors ”
“demon no 7 ” said virginia approaching him and patting him on the
head “don’t be cross we’re just exploring secret passages that’s
all ”
“there seems to be a positive boom in secret passages to-day ” grumbled
lord caterham not yet completely mollified “i’ve had to show that
fellow fish round them all this morning ”
“when was that ” asked battle quickly “just before lunch it seems he’d heard of the one in here i showed
him that and then took him up to the white gallery and we finished
up with the priest’s hole but his enthusiasm was waning by that time he looked bored to death but i made him go through with it ” lord
caterham chuckled at the remembrance anthony put a hand on lemoine’s arm “come outside ” he said softly “i want to speak to you ”
the two men went out together through the window when they had gone a
sufficient distance from the house anthony drew from his pocket the
scrap of paper that boris had given him that morning “look here ” he said “did you drop this ”
lemoine took it and examined it with some interest “no ” he said “i have never seen it before why ”
“quite sure ”
“absolutely sure monsieur ”
“that’s very odd ”
he repeated to lemoine what boris had said the other listened with
close attention “no i did not drop it you say he found it in that clump of trees ”
“well i assumed so but he did not actually say so ”
“it is just possible that it might have fluttered out of m isaacstein’s suit-case question boris again ” he handed the paper back
to anthony after a minute or two he said: “what exactly do you know of
this man boris ”
anthony shrugged his shoulders “i understood he was the late prince michael’s trusted servant ”
“it may be so but make it your business to find out ask some one who
knows such as the baron lolopretjzyl perhaps this man was engaged but
a few weeks ago for myself i have believed him honest but who knows king victor is quite capable of making himself into a trusted servant
at a moment’s notice ”
“do you really think——”
lemoine interrupted him “i will be quite frank with me king victor is an obsession i see him
everywhere at this moment even i ask myself—this man who is talking
to me this m cade is he perhaps king victor ”
“good lord ” said anthony “you have got it badly ”
“what do i care for the diamond for the discovery of the murderer of
prince michael i leave those affairs to my colleague of scotland yard
whose business it is me i am in england for one purpose and one
purpose only to capture king victor and to capture him red-handed nothing else matters ”
“think you’ll do it ” asked anthony lighting a cigarette “how should i know ” said lemoine with sudden despondency “h’m ” said anthony they had regained the terrace superintendent battle was standing near
the french window in a wooden attitude “look at poor old battle ” said anthony “let’s go and cheer him up ”
he paused a minute and said “you know you’re an odd fish in some
ways m lemoine ”
“in what ways m cade ”
“well ” said anthony “in your place i should have been inclined
to note down that address that i showed you it may be of no
importance—quite conceivably on the other hand it might be very
important indeed ”
lemoine looked at him for a minute or two steadily then with a slight
smile he drew back the cuff of his left coat sleeve pencilled on the
white shirt-cuff beneath were the words “hurstmere langly road dover ”
“i apologize ” said anthony “and i retire worsted ”
he joined superintendent battle “you look very pensive battle ” he remarked “i’ve got a lot to think about mr cade ”
“yes i expect you have ”
“things aren’t dovetailing they’re not dovetailing at all ”
“very trying ” sympathized anthony “never mind battle if the worst
comes to the worst you can always arrest me you’ve got my guilty
footprints to fall back upon remember ”
but the superintendent did not smile “got any enemies here that you know of mr cade ” he asked “i’ve an idea that the third footman doesn’t like me ” replied
anthony lightly “he does his best to forget to hand me the choicest
vegetables why ”
“i’ve been getting anonymous letters ” said superintendent battle “or
rather an anonymous letter i should say ”
“about me ”
without answering battle took a folded sheet of cheap notepaper from
his pocket and handed it to anthony scrawled on it in an illiterate
handwriting were the words:
“look out for mr cade he isn’t wot he seems ”
anthony handed it back with a light laugh “that’s all cheer up battle i’m really a king in disguise you know ”
he went into the house whistling lightly as he walked along but as
he entered his bedroom and shut the door behind him his face changed it grew set and stern he sat down on the edge of the bed and stared
moodily at the floor “things are getting serious ” said anthony to himself “something must
be done about it it’s all damned awkward ”
he sat there for a minute or two then strolled to the window for a
moment or two he stood looking out aimlessly and then his eyes became
suddenly focused on a certain spot and his face lightened “of course ” he said “the rose garden that’s it the rose garden ”
he hurried downstairs again and out into the garden by a side door he
approached the rose garden by a circuitous route it had a little gate
at either end he entered by the far one and walked up to the sundial
which was on a raised hillock in the exact centre of the garden just as anthony reached it he stopped dead and stared at another
occupant of the rose garden who seemed equally surprised to see him “i didn’t know that you were interested in roses mr fish ” said
anthony gently “sir ” said mr fish “i am considerably interested in roses ”
they looked at each other warily as antagonists seek to measure their
opponents’ strength “so am i ” said anthony “is that so ”
“in fact i dote upon roses ” said anthony airily a very slight smile hovered upon mr fish’s lips and at the same time
anthony also smiled the tension seemed to relax “look at this beauty now ” said mr fish stooping to point out a
particularly fine bloom “madame abel chatenay i pressoom it to be yes i am right this white rose before the war was known as frau
carl drusky they have i believe renamed it over sensitive perhaps
but truly patriotic the la france is always popular do you care for
red roses at all mr cade a bright scarlet rose now——”
mr fish’s slow drawling voice was interrupted bundle was leaning out
of a first-floor window “care for a spin to town mr fish i’m just off ”
“thank you lady eileen but i am vurry happy here ”
“sure you won’t change your mind mr cade ”
anthony laughed and shook his head bundle disappeared “sleep is more in my line ” said anthony with a wide yawn “a good
after luncheon nap ” he took out a cigarette “you haven’t got a match have you ”
mr fish handed him a match-box anthony helped himself and handed
back the box with a word of thanks “roses ” said anthony “are all very well but i don’t feel
particularly horticultural this afternoon ”
with a disarming smile he nodded cheerfully a thundering noise sounded from just outside the house “pretty powerful engine she’s got in that car of hers ” remarked
anthony “there off she goes ”
they had a view of the car speeding down the long drive anthony yawned again and strolled towards the house he passed in through the door once inside he seemed as though changed
to quicksilver he raced across the hall out through one of the
windows on the farther side and across the park bundle he knew had
to make a big détour by the lodge gates and through the village he ran desperately it was a race against time he reached the park
wall just as he heard the car outside he swung himself up and dropped
into the road “hi ” cried anthony in her astonishment bundle swerved half across the road she managed
to pull up without accident anthony ran after the car opened the
door and jumped in beside bundle “i’m coming to london with you ” he said “i meant to all along ”
“extraordinary person ” said bundle “what’s that you’ve got in your
hand ”
“only a match ” said anthony he regarded it thoughtfully it was pink with a yellow head he threw
away his unlighted cigarette and put the match carefully into his
pocket "

the house at dover
“you don’t mind i suppose ” said bundle after a minute or two “if i
drive rather fast i started later than i meant to do ”
it had seemed to anthony that they were proceeding at a terrific speed
already but he soon saw that that was nothing compared to what bundle
could get out of the panhard if she tried “some people ” said bundle as she slowed down momentarily to pass
through a village “are terrified of my driving poor old father for
instance nothing would induce him to come up with me in this old bus ”
privately anthony thought lord caterham was entirely justified driving with bundle was not a sport to be indulged in by nervous middle-aged gentlemen “but you don’t seem nervous a bit ” continued bundle approvingly as
she swept round a corner on two wheels “i’m in pretty good training you see ” explained anthony gravely “also ” he added as an afterthought “i’m rather in a hurry myself ”
“shall i speed her up a bit more ” asked bundle kindly “good lord no ” said anthony hastily “we’re averaging about fifty as
it is ”
“i’m burning with curiosity to know the reason of this sudden
departure ” said bundle after executing a fanfare upon the klaxon
which must temporarily have deafened the neighbourhood “but i suppose
i mustn’t ask you’re not escaping from justice are you ”
“i’m not quite sure ” said anthony “i shall know soon ”
“that scotland yard man isn’t as much of a rabbit as i thought ” said
bundle thoughtfully “battle’s a good man ” agreed anthony “you ought to have been in diplomacy ” remarked bundle “you don’t part
with much information do you ”
“i was under the impression that i babbled ”
“oh boy you’re not eloping with mademoiselle brun by any chance ”
“not guilty ” said anthony with fervour there was a pause of some minutes during which bundle caught up and
passed three other cars then she asked suddenly:
“how long have you known virginia ”
“that’s a difficult question to answer ” said anthony with perfect
truth “i haven’t actually met her very often and yet i seem to have
known her a long time ”
bundle nodded “virginia’s got brains ” she remarked abruptly “she’s always talking
nonsense but she’s got brains all right she was frightfully good out
in herzoslovakia i believe if tim revel had lived he’d have had a
fine career—and mostly owing to virginia she worked for him tooth and
nail she did everything in the world she could for him—and i know
why too ”
“because she cared for him ” anthony sat looking very straight ahead of
him “no because she didn’t don’t you see she didn’t love him—she never
loved him and so she did everything on earth she could to make up that’s virginia all over but don’t you make any mistake about it virginia was never in love with tim revel ”
“you seem very positive ” said anthony turning to look at her bundle’s little hands were clenched on the steering wheel and her
chin was stuck out in a determined manner “i know a thing or two i was only a kid at the time of her marriage but i heard one or two things and knowing virginia i can put them
together easily enough tim revel was bowled over by virginia—he was
irish you know and most attractive with a genius for expressing
himself well virginia was quite young—eighteen she couldn’t go
anywhere without seeing tim in a state of picturesque misery vowing
he’d shoot himself or take to drink if she didn’t marry him girls
believe these things—or used to—we’ve advanced a lot in the last
eight years virginia was carried away by the feeling she thought she’d
inspired she married him—and she was an angel to him always she
wouldn’t have been half as much of an angel if she’d loved him there’s
a lot of the devil in virginia but i can tell you one thing—she
enjoys her freedom and anyone will have a hard time persuading her to
give it up ”
“i wonder why you tell me all this ” said anthony slowly “it’s interesting to know about people isn’t it some people that is ”
“i’ve wanted to know ” he acknowledged “and you’d never have heard from virginia but you can trust me for an
inside tip from the stables virginia’s a darling even women like her
because she isn’t a bit of a cat and anyway ” bundle ended somewhat
obscurely “one must be a sport mustn’t one ”
“oh certainly ” anthony agreed but he was still puzzled he had no
idea what had prompted bundle to give him so much information unasked that he was glad of it he did not deny “here are the trams ” said bundle with a sigh “now i suppose i
shall have to drive carefully ”
“it might be as well ” agreed anthony his ideas and bundle’s on the subject of careful driving hardly
coincided leaving indignant suburbs behind them they finally emerged
into oxford street “not bad going eh ” said bundle glancing at her wrist watch anthony assented fervently “where do you want to be dropped ”
“anywhere which way are you going ”
“knightsbridge way ”
“all right drop me at hyde park corner ”
“good-bye ” said bundle as she drew up at the place indicated “what
about the return journey ”
“i’ll find my own way back thanks very much ”
“i _have_ scared him ” remarked bundle “i shouldn’t recommend driving with you as a tonic for nervous old
ladies but personally i’ve enjoyed it the last time i was in equal
danger was when i was charged by a herd of wild elephants ”
“i think you’re extremely rude ” remarked bundle “we’ve not even had
one bump to-day ”
“i’m sorry if you’ve been holding yourself in on my account ” retorted
anthony “i don’t think men are really very brave ” said bundle “that’s a nasty one ” said anthony “i retire humiliated ” bundle
nodded and drove on anthony hailed a passing taxi “victoria station ”
he said to the driver as he got in when he got to victoria he paid off the taxi and inquired for the next
train to dover unfortunately he had just missed one resigning himself to a wait of something over an hour anthony paced up
and down his brows knit once or twice he shook his head impatiently the journey to dover was uneventful arrived there anthony passed
quickly out of the station and then as though suddenly remembering he turned back again there was a slight smile on his lips as he asked
to be directed to hurstmere langly road the road in question was a long one leading right out of the town according to the porter’s instructions hurstmere was the last house anthony trudged along steadily the little pucker had reappeared
between his eyes nevertheless there was a new elation in his manner as always when danger was near at hand hurstmere was as the porter had said the last house in langly road it stood well back enclosed in its own grounds which were ragged and
overgrown the place anthony judged must have been empty for many
years a large iron gate swung rustily on its hinges and the name on
the gatepost was half obliterated “a lonely spot ” muttered anthony to himself “and a good one to
choose ”
he hesitated a minute or two glanced quickly up and down the
road—which was quite deserted—and then slipped quietly past the
creaking gate into the overgrown drive he walked up it a little
way and then stood listening he was still some distance from the
house not a sound could be heard anywhere some fast yellowing leaves
detached themselves from one of the trees overhead and fell with a
soft rustling sound that was almost sinister in the stillness anthony
started; then smiled “nerves ” he murmured to himself “never knew i had such things before ”
he went on up the drive presently as the drive curved he slipped
into the shrubbery and so continued his way unseen from the house suddenly he stood still peering out through the leaves some distance
away a dog was barking but it was a sound nearer at hand that had
attracted anthony’s attention his keen hearing had not been mistaken a man came rapidly round
the corner of the house a short square thickset man foreign in
appearance he did not pause but walked steadily on circling the house
and disappearing again anthony nodded to himself “sentry ” he murmured “they do the thing quite well ”
as soon as he had passed anthony went on diverging to the left and
so following in the footsteps of the sentry his own footsteps were quite noiseless the wall of the house was on his right and presently he came to where
a broad blur of light fell on the gravelled walk the sound of several
men talking together was clearly audible “my god what double-dyed idiots ” murmured anthony to himself “it
would serve them right to be given a fright ”
he stole up to the window stooping a little so that he should not be
seen presently he lifted his head very carefully to the level of the
sill and looked in half a dozen men were sprawling round a table four of them were big
thickset men with high cheek-bones and eyes set in magyar slanting
fashion the other two were rat-like little men with quick gestures the language that was being spoken was french but the four big men
spoke it with uncertainty and a hoarse guttural intonation “the boss ” growled one of these “when will he be here ”
one of the smaller men shrugged his shoulders “any time now ”
“about time too ” growled the first man “i have never seen him this
boss of yours but oh what great and glorious work might we not have
accomplished in these days of idle waiting ”
“fool ” said the other little man bitingly “getting nabbed by the
police is all the great and glorious work you and your precious lot
would have been likely to accomplish a lot of blundering gorillas ”
“aha ” roared another big thickset fellow “you insult the comrades i
will soon set the sign of the red hand round your throat ”
he half rose glaring ferociously at the frenchman but one of his
companions pulled him back again “no quarreling ” he grunted “we’re to work together from all i heard
this king victor doesn’t stand for being disobeyed ”
in the darkness anthony heard the footsteps of the sentry coming his
round again and he drew back behind a bush “who’s that ” said one of the men inside “carlo—going his rounds ”
“oh what about the prisoner ”
“he’s all right—coming round pretty fast now he’s recovered well from
the crack on the head we gave him ”
anthony moved gently away “god what a lot ” he muttered “they discuss their affairs with an
open window and that fool carlo goes his round with the tread of an
elephant and the eyes of a bat and to crown all the herzoslovakians
and the french are on the point of coming to blows king victor’s
headquarters seem to be in a parlous condition it would amuse me it
would amuse me very much to teach them a lesson ”
he stood irresolute for a minute smiling to himself from somewhere above his head came a stifled groan anthony looked up the groan came again anthony glanced quickly from left to right carlo was not due round
again just yet he grasped the heavy virginia creeper and climbed
nimbly till he reached the sill of a window the window was shut but
with a tool from his pocket he soon succeeded in forcing up the catch he paused a minute to listen then sprang lightly inside the room there was a bed in the far corner and on that bed a man was lying his
figure barely discernible in the gloom anthony went over to the bed and flashed his pocket torch on the man’s
face it was a foreign face pale and emaciated and the head was
swathed in heavy bandages the man was bound hand and foot he stared up at anthony like one dazed anthony bent over him and as he did so he heard a sound behind him and
swung round his hand travelling to his coat pocket but a sharp command arrested him “hands up sonny you didn’t expect to see me here but i happened to
catch the same train as you at victoria ”
it was mr hiram fish who was standing in the doorway he was smiling
and in his hand was a big blue automatic "

tuesday night at chimneys
lord caterham virginia and bundle were sitting in the library after
dinner it was tuesday evening some thirty hours had elapsed since
anthony’s rather dramatic departure for at least the seventh time bundle repeated anthony’s parting words as spoken at hyde park corner “i’ll find my own way back ” repeated virginia thoughtfully “that
doesn’t look as though he expected to be away as long as this and he’s
left all his things here ”
“he didn’t tell you where he was going ”
“no ” said virginia looking straight in front of her “he told me
nothing ”
after this there was a silence for a minute or two lord caterham was
the first to break it “on the whole ” he said “keeping an hotel has some advantages over
keeping a country house ”
“meaning—— ”
“that little notice they always hang up in your room visitors
intending departure must give notice before twelve o’clock ”
virginia smiled “i dare say ” he continued “that i am old-fashioned and unreasonable it’s the fashion i know to pop in and out of a house same idea as an
hotel—perfect freedom of action and no bill at the end ”
“you are an old grouser ” said bundle “you’ve had virginia and me what more do you want ”
“nothing more nothing more ” lord caterham assured them hastily “that’s not it at all it’s the principle of the thing it gives one
such a restless feeling i’m quite willing to admit that it’s been an
almost ideal twenty-four hours peace—perfect peace no burglaries or
other crimes of violence no detectives no americans what i complain
of is that i should have enjoyed it all so much more if i’d felt really
secure as it is all the time i’ve been saying to myself ‘one or other
of them is bound to turn up in a minute ’ and that spoilt the whole
thing ”
“well nobody has turned up ” said bundle “we’ve been left severely
alone—neglected in fact it’s odd the way fish disappeared didn’t he
say anything ”
“not a word last time i saw him he was pacing up and down the rose
garden yesterday afternoon smoking one of those unpleasant cigars of
his after that he seems to have just melted into the landscape ”
“somebody must have kidnapped him ” said bundle hopefully “in another day or two i expect we shall have scotland yard dragging
the lake to find his dead body ” said her father gloomily “it serves
me right at my time of life i ought to have gone quietly abroad and
taken care of my health and not allowed myself to be drawn into george
lomax’s wild-cat schemes i——”
he was interrupted by tredwell “well ” said lord caterham irritably “what is it ”
“the french detective is here my lord and would be glad if you could
spare him a few minutes ”
“what did i tell you ” said lord caterham “i knew it was too good to
last depend upon it they’ve found fish’s dead body doubled up in the
goldfish pond ”
tredwell in a strictly respectful manner steered him back to the
point of issue “am i to say that you will see him my lord ”
“yes yes bring him in here ”
tredwell departed he returned a minute or two later announcing in a
lugubrious voice:
“monsieur lemoine ”
the frenchman came in with a quick light step his walk more than his
face betrayed the fact that he was excited about something “good evening lemoine ” said lord caterham “have a drink won’t you ”
“i thank you no ” he bowed punctiliously to the ladies “at last i
make progress as things are i felt that you should be acquainted with
the discoveries—the very grave discoveries that i have made in the
course of the last twenty-four hours ”
“i thought there must be something important going on somewhere ” said
lord caterham “my lord yesterday afternoon one of your guests left this house in
a curious manner from the beginning i must tell you i have had my
suspicions here is a man who comes from the wilds two months ago he
was in south africa before that—where ”
virginia drew a sharp breath for a moment the frenchman’s eyes rested
on her doubtfully then he went on:
“before that—where none can say and he is just such a one as
the man i am looking for—gay audacious reckless one who would
dare anything i send cable after cable but i can get no word as
to his past life ten years ago he was in canada yes but since
then—silence my suspicions grow stronger then i picked up one
day a scrap of paper where he has lately passed along it bears an
address—the address of a house in dover later as though by chance i drop that same piece of paper out of the tail of my eye i see this
boris this herzoslovakian pick it up and take it to his master all along i have been sure that this boris is an emissary of the
comrades of the red hand we know that the comrades are working in with
king victor over this affair if boris recognized his chief in mr anthony cade would he not do just what he has done—transferred his
allegiance why should he attach himself otherwise to an insignificant
stranger it was suspicious i tell you very suspicious “but almost i am disarmed for anthony cade brings this same paper to
me at once and asks me if i have dropped it as i say almost i am
disarmed—but not quite for it may mean that he is innocent or it may
mean that he is very very clever i deny of course that it is mine
or that i dropped it but in the meantime i have set inquiries on foot only to-day i have news the house at dover has been precipitately
abandoned but up till yesterday afternoon it was occupied by a body
of foreigners not a doubt but that it was king victor’s headquarters now see the significance of these points yesterday afternoon mr cade
clears out from here precipitately ever since he dropped that paper he must know that the game is up he reaches dover and immediately the
gang is disbanded what the next move will be i do not know what
is quite certain is that mr anthony cade will not return here but
knowing king victor as i do i am certain that he will not abandon
the game without having one more try for the jewel and that is when i
shall get him ”
virginia stood up suddenly she walked across to the mantelpiece and
spoke in a voice that rang cold like steel “you are leaving one thing out of account i think m lemoine ” she
said “mr cade is not the only guest who disappeared yesterday in a
suspicious manner ”
“you mean madame—— ”
“that all you have said applies equally well to another person what
about mr hiram fish ”
“oh mr fish ”
“yes mr fish did you not tell us that first night that king
victor had lately come to england from america so has mr fish come
to england from america it is true that he brought a letter of
introduction from a very well-known man but surely that would be a
simple thing for a man like king victor to manage he is certainly not
what he pretends to be lord caterham has commented on the fact that
when it is a question of the first editions he is supposed to have
come here to see he is always the listener never the talker and there
are several suspicious facts against him there was a light in his
window the night of the murder then take that evening in the council
chamber when i met him on the terrace he was fully dressed _he_ could
have dropped the paper you didn’t actually _see_ mr cade do so mr cade may have gone to dover if he did it was simply to investigate he
may have been kidnapped there i say that there is far more suspicion
attaching to mr fish’s actions than to mr cade’s ”
the frenchman’s voice rang out sharply:
“from your point of view that well may be madame i do not dispute
it and i agree that mr fish is not what he seems ”
“well then ”
“but that makes no difference _you see madame mr fish is a
pinkerton’s man _”
“what ” cried lord caterham “yes lord caterham he came over here to trail king victor superintendent battle and i have known this for some time ”
virginia said nothing very slowly she sat down again with those few
words the structure that she had built up so carefully was scattered in
ruins about her feet “you see ” lemoine was continuing “we have all known that eventually
king victor would come to chimneys it was the one place we were sure
of catching him ”
virginia looked up with an odd light in her eyes and suddenly she
laughed “you’ve not caught him yet ” she said lemoine looked at her curiously “no madame but i shall ”
“he’s supposed to be rather famous for outwitting people isn’t he ”
the frenchman’s face darkened with anger “this time it will be different ” he said between his teeth “he’s a very attractive fellow ” said lord caterham “very attractive but surely—why you said he was an old friend of yours virginia ”
“that is why ” said virginia composedly “i think m lemoine must be
making a mistake ”
and her eyes met the detective’s steadily but he appeared in no wise
discomfited “time will show madame ” he said “do you pretend that it was he who shot prince michael ” she asked
presently “certainly ”
but virginia shook her head “oh no ” she said “oh no that is one thing i am quite sure of anthony cade never killed prince michael ”
lemoine was watching her intently “there is a possibility that you are right madame ” he said slowly “a
possibility that is all it may have been the herzoslovakian boris who exceeded his orders and fired that shot who knows prince michael
may have done him some great wrong and the man sought revenge ”
“he looks a murderous sort of fellow ” agreed lord caterham “the
house-maids i believe scream when he passes them in the passages ”
“well ” said lemoine “i must be going now i felt it was due to you my lord to know exactly how things stand ”
“very kind of you i’m sure ” said lord caterham “quite certain you
won’t have a drink all right then good night ”
“i hate that man with his prim little black beard and his eyeglasses ”
said bundle as soon as the door had shut behind him “i hope anthony
_does_ snoo him i’d love to see him dancing with rage what do you
think about it all virginia ”
“i don’t know ” said virginia “i’m tired i shall go up to bed ”
“not a bad idea ” said lord caterham “it’s half-past eleven ”
as virginia was crossing the wide hall she caught sight of a broad
back that seemed familiar to her discreetly vanishing through a side
door “superintendent battle ” she called imperiously the superintendent for it was indeed he retraced his steps with a
shade of unwillingness “yes mrs revel ”
“m lemoine has been here he says—— tell me is it true really
true that mr fish is an american detective ”
superintendent battle nodded “that’s right ”
“you have known it all along ”
again superintendent battle nodded virginia turned away towards the staircase “i see ” she said “thank you ”
until that minute she had refused to believe and now—— sitting down before her dressing-table in her own room she faced the
question squarely every word that anthony had said came back to her
fraught with a new significance was this the “trade” that he had spoken of the trade that he had given up but then——
an unusual sound disturbed the even tenor of her meditations she
lifted her head with a start her little gold clock showed the hour to
be after one nearly two hours she had sat here thinking again the sound was repeated a sharp tap on the window-pane virginia
went to the window and opened it below on the pathway was a tall
figure which even as she looked stooped for another handful of gravel for a moment virginia’s heart beat faster—then she recognized the
massive strength and square-cut outline of the herzoslovakian boris “yes ” she said in a low tone “what is it ”
at the moment it did not strike her as strange that boris should be
throwing gravel at her window at this hour of the night “what is it ” she repeated impatiently “i come from the master ” said boris in a low tone which nevertheless
carried perfectly “he has sent for you ”
he made the statement in a perfectly matter-of-fact tone “sent for me ”
“yes i am to bring you to him there is a note i will throw it up to
you ”
virginia stood back a little and a slip of paper weighted with a
stone fell accurately at her feet she unfolded it and read:
“_my dear_ (anthony had written) —_i’m in a tight place but i mean to
win through will you trust me and come to me _”
for quite two minutes virginia stood there immovable reading those
few words over again and again she raised her head looking round the well-appointed luxury of the
bedroom as though she saw it with new eyes then she leaned out of the window again “what am i to do ” she asked “the detectives are the other side of the house outside the council
chamber come down and out through this side door i will be there i
have a car waiting outside in the road ”
virginia nodded quickly she changed her dress for one of fawn tricot and pulled on a little fawn leather hat then smiling a little she wrote a short note addressed it to bundle
and pinned it to the pincushion she stole quietly downstairs and undid the bolts of the side door just
a moment she paused then with a little gallant toss of the head the
same toss of the head which her ancestors had gone into action in the
crusades she passed through "
Chapter 26,"26
the 13th of october
at ten o’clock on the morning of wednesday the 13th of october anthony cade walked into harridge’s hotel and asked for baron
lolopretjzyl who was occupying a suite there after suitable and imposing delay anthony was taken to the suite
in question the baron was standing on the hearthrug in a correct
and stiff fashion little captain andrassy equally correct as to
demeanour but with a slightly hostile attitude was also present the usual bows clicking of heels and other formal greetings of
etiquette took place anthony was by now thoroughly conversant with
the routine “you will forgive this early call i trust baron ” he said cheerfully laying down his hat and stick on the table “as a matter of fact i
have a little business proposition to make to you ”
“ha is that so ” said the baron captain andrassy who had never overcome his initial distrust of
anthony looked suspicious “business ” said anthony “is based on the well-known principle of
supply and demand you want something the other man has it the only
thing left to settle is the price ”
the baron looked at him attentively but said nothing “between a herzoslovakian nobleman and an english gentleman the terms
should be easily arranged ” said anthony rapidly he blushed a little as he said it such words do not rise easily to
an englishman’s lips but he had observed on previous occasions the
enormous effect of such phraseology upon the baron’s mentality true
enough the charm worked “that is so ” said the baron approvingly nodding his head “that is
entirely so ”
even captain andrassy appeared to unbend a little and nodded his head
also “very good ” said anthony “i won’t beat about the bush any more——”
“what is that you say ” interrupted the baron “to beat about the
bush i do not comprehend ”
“a mere figure of speech baron to speak in plain english _you_ want
the goods _we_ have them the ship is all very well but it lacks a
figurehead by the ship i mean the loyalist party of herzoslovakia at the present minute you lack the principal plank of your political
programme you are minus a prince now supposing—only supposing that
i could supply you with a prince ”
the baron stared “i do not comprehend you in the least ” he declared “sir ” said captain andrassy twirling his moustache fiercely “you are
insulting ”
“not at all ” said anthony “i’m trying to be helpful supply and
demand you understand it’s all perfectly fair and square no
princes supplied unless genuine—see trademark if we come to terms you’ll find it’s quite all right i’m offering you the real genuine
article—out of the bottom drawer ”
“not in the least ” the baron declared again “do i comprehend you ”
“it doesn’t really matter ” said anthony kindly “i just want you
to get used to the idea to put it vulgarly i’ve got something up
my sleeve just get hold of this you want a prince under certain
conditions i will undertake to supply you with one ”
the baron and andrassy stared at him anthony took up his hat and stick
again and prepared to depart “just think it over now baron there is one thing further you must
come down to chimneys this evening—captain andrassy also several
very curious things are likely to happen there shall we make an
appointment say in the council chamber at nine o’clock thank you gentlemen i may rely upon you to be there ”
the baron took a step forward and looked searchingly in anthony’s face “mr cade ” he said not without dignity “it is not i hope that you
wish to make fun of me ”
anthony returned his gaze steadily “baron ” he said and there was a curious note in his voice “when this
evening is over i think you will be the first to admit that there is
more earnest than jest about this business ”
bowing to both the men he left the room his next call was in the city where he sent in his card to mr herman
isaacstein after some delay anthony was received by a pale and exquisitely
dressed underling with an engaging manner and a military title “you wanted to see mr isaacstein didn’t you ” said the young man “i’m afraid he’s most awfully busy this morning—board meetings and all
that sort of thing you know is it anything that i can do ”
“i must see him personally ” said anthony and added carelessly “i’ve
just come up from chimneys ”
the young man was slightly staggered by the mention of chimneys “oh ” he said doubtfully “well i’ll see ”
“tell him it’s important ” said anthony “message from lord caterham ” suggested the young man “something of the kind ” said anthony “but it’s imperative that i
should see mr isaacstein at once ”
two minutes later anthony was conducted into a sumptuous inner sanctum
where he was principally impressed by the immense size and roomy
depths of the leather-covered arm-chairs mr isaacstein rose to greet him “you must forgive my looking you up like this ” said anthony “i know
that you’re a busy man and i’m not going to waste more of your time
than i can help it’s just a little matter of business that i want to
put before you ”
isaacstein looked at him attentively for a minute or two out of his
beady black eyes “have a cigar ” he said unexpectedly holding out an open box “thank you ” said anthony “i don’t mind if i do ”
he helped himself “it’s about this herzoslovakian business ” continued anthony as he
accepted a match he noted the momentary flickering of the other’s
steady gaze “the murder of prince michael must have rather upset the
applecart ”
mr isaacstein raised one eyebrow murmured “ah ” interrogatively and
transferred his gaze to the ceiling “oil ” said anthony thoughtfully surveying the polished surface of the
desk “wonderful thing oil ”
he felt the slight start the financier gave “do you mind coming to the point mr cade ”
“not at all i imagine mr isaacstein that if those oil concessions
are granted to another company you won’t be exactly pleased about it ”
“what’s the proposition ” asked the other looking straight at him “a suitable claimant to the throne full of pro-british sympathies ”
“where have you got him ”
“that’s my business ”
isaacstein acknowledged the retort by a slight smile his glance had
grown hard and keen “the genuine article i can’t stand for any funny business ”
“the absolute genuine article ”
“straight ”
“straight ”
“i’ll take your word for it ”
“you don’t seem to take much convincing ” said anthony looking
curiously at him herman isaacstein smiled “i shouldn’t be where i am now if i hadn’t learnt to know whether a man
is speaking the truth or not ” he replied simply “what terms do you
want ”
“the same loan on the same conditions that you offered to prince
michael ”
“what about yourself ”
“for the moment nothing except that i want you to come down to
chimneys to-night ”
“no ” said isaacstein with some decision “i can’t do that ”
“why ”
“dining out—rather an important dinner ”
“all the same i’m afraid you’ll have to cut it out—for your own sake ”
“what do you mean ”
anthony looked at him for a full minute before he said slowly:
“do you know that they’ve found the revolver the one michael was shot
with do you know where they found it in your suit-case ”
“what ”
isaacstein almost leapt from his chair his face was frenzied “what are you saying what do you mean ”
“i’ll tell you ”
very obligingly anthony narrated the occurrences in connection with
the finding of the revolver as he spoke the other’s face assumed a
greyish tinge of absolute terror “but it’s false ” he screamed out as anthony finished “i never put it
there i know nothing about it it is a plot ”
“don’t excite yourself ” said anthony soothingly “if that’s the case
you’ll easily be able to prove it ”
“prove it how can i prove it ”
“if i were you ” said anthony gently “i’d come to chimneys to-night ”
isaacstein looked at him doubtfully “you advise it ”
anthony leant forward and whispered to him the financier fell back in
amazement staring at him “you actually mean——”
“come and see ” said anthony "

the 13th of october (contd )
the clock in the council chamber struck nine “well ” said lord caterham with a deep sigh “here they all are just
like little bo peep’s flock back again and wagging their tails behind
them ”
he looked sadly round the room “organ grinder complete with monkey ” he murmured fixing the baron
with his eye “nosy parker of throgmorton street——”
“i think you’re rather unkind to the baron ” protested bundle to whom
these confidences were being poured out “he told me that he considered
you the perfect example of english hospitality amongst the _haute
noblesse_ ”
“i daresay ” said lord caterham “he’s always saying things like that it makes him most fatiguing to talk to but i can tell you i’m not
nearly as much of the hospitable english gentleman as i was as soon
as i can i shall let chimneys to an enterprising american and go and
live in an hotel there if anyone worries you you can just ask for
your bill and go ”
“cheer up ” said bundle “we seem to have lost mr fish for good ”
“i always found him rather amusing ” said lord caterham who was in a
contradictory temper “it’s that precious young man of yours who has
let me in for this why should i have this board meeting called in my
house why doesn’t he rent the larches or elmhurst or some nice villa
residence like that at streatham and hold his company meetings there ”
“wrong atmosphere ” said bundle “no one is going to play any tricks on us i hope ” said her father
nervously “i don’t trust that french fellow lemoine the french
police are up to all sorts of dodges put india-rubber bands round
your arm and then reconstruct the crime and make you jump and it’s
registered on a thermometer i know that when they call out ‘who
killed prince michael ’ i shall register a hundred and twenty-two or
something perfectly frightful and they’ll haul me off to gaol at once ”
the door opened and tredwell announced:
“mr george lomax mr eversleigh ”
“enter codders followed by faithful dog ” murmured bundle bill made a bee-line for her whilst george greeted lord caterham in
the genial manner he assumed for public occasions “my dear caterham ” said george shaking him by the hand “i got your
message and came over of course ”
“very good of you my dear fellow very good of you delighted to see
you ” lord caterham’s conscience always drove him on to an excess of
geniality when he was conscious of feeling none “not that it was my
message but that doesn’t matter at all ”
in the meantime bill was attacking bundle in an undertone “i say what’s it all about what’s this i hear about virginia bolting
off in the middle of the night she’s not been kidnapped has she ”
“oh no ” said bundle “she left a note pinned to the pincushion in the
orthodox fashion ”
“she’s not gone off with anyone has she not with that colonial
johnny i never liked the fellow and from all i hear there seems to
be an idea floating around that he himself is the super crook but i
don’t quite see how that can be ”
“why not ”
“well this king victor was a french fellow and cade’s english enough ”
“you don’t happen to have heard that king victor was an accomplished
linguist and moreover was half irish ”
“oh lord then that’s why he’s made himself scarce is it ”
“i don’t know about his making himself scarce he disappeared the day
before yesterday as you know but this morning we got a wire from him saying he would be down here at 9 p m to-night and suggesting that
codders should be asked over all these other people have turned up as
well—asked by mr cade ”
“it is a gathering ” said bill looking round “one french detective
by window one english ditto by fireplace strong foreign element the
stars and stripes don’t seem to be represented ”
bundle shook her head “mr fish has disappeared into the blue virginia’s not here either but every one else is assembled and i have a feeling in my bones bill that we are drawing very near to the moment when somebody says
‘james the footman ’ and everything is revealed we’re only waiting
now for anthony cade to arrive ”
“he’ll never show up ” said bill “then why call this company meeting as father calls it ”
“ah there’s some deep idea behind that depend upon it wants us all
here while he’s somewhere else—you know the sort of thing ”
“you don’t think he’ll come then ”
“no fear run his head into the lion’s mouth why the room’s bristling
with detectives and high officials ”
“you don’t know much about king victor if you think that would deter
him by all accounts it’s the kind of situation he loves above all and he always manages to come out on top ”
mr eversleigh shook his head doubtfully “that would take some doing—with the dice loaded against him he’ll
never——”
the door opened again and tredwell announced:
“mr cade ”
anthony came straight across to his host “lord caterham ” he said “i’m giving you a frightful lot of trouble and i’m awfully sorry about it but i really do think that to-night
will see the clearing up of the mystery ”
lord caterham looked mollified he had always had a secret liking for
anthony “no trouble at all ” he said heartily “it’s very kind of you ” said anthony “we’re all here i see then i
can get on with the good work ”
“i don’t understand ” said george lomax weightily “i don’t understand
in the least this is all very irregular mr cade has no standing—no
standing whatever the position is a very difficult and delicate one i
am strongly of the opinion——”
george’s flood of eloquence was arrested moving unobtrusively to the
great man’s side superintendent battle whispered a few words in his
ear george looked perplexed and baffled “very well if you say so ” he remarked grudgingly then added in a
louder tone “i’m sure we are all willing to listen to what mr cade
has to say ”
anthony ignored the palpable condescension of the other’s tone “it’s just a little idea of mine that’s all ” he said cheerfully “probably all of you know that we got hold of a certain message in
cipher the other day there was a reference to richmond and some
numbers ” he paused “well we had a shot at solving it—and we failed now in the late count stylptitch’s memoirs (which i happen to have
read) there is a reference to a certain dinner—a ‘flower’ dinner
which every one attended wearing a badge representing a flower the
count himself wore the exact duplicate of that curious device we found
in the cavity in the secret passage it represented a rose if you
remember it was all _rows_ of things—buttons letter e’s and finally
rows of knitting now gentlemen what is there in this house that
is arranged in rows books isn’t that so add to that that in the
catalogue of lord caterham’s library there is a book called _the life
of the earl of richmond_ and i think you will get a very fair idea
of the hiding-place starting at the volume in question and using
the numbers to denote shelves and books i think you will find that
the—er—object of our search is concealed in a dummy book or in a
cavity behind a particular book ”
anthony looked round modestly obviously waiting for applause “upon my word that’s very ingenious ” said lord caterham “quite ingenious ” admitted george condescendingly “but it remains to
be seen——”
anthony laughed “the proof of the pudding’s in the eating—eh well i’ll soon settle
that for you ” he sprang to his feet “i’ll go to the library——”
he got no further m lemoine moved forward from the window “just one moment mr cade you permit lord caterham ”
he went to the writing-table and hurriedly scribbled a few lines he sealed them up in an envelope and then rang the bell tredwell
appeared in answer to it lemoine handed him the note “see that that is delivered at once if you please ”
“very good sir ” said tredwell with his usual dignified tread he withdrew anthony who had been standing irresolute sat down again “what’s the big idea lemoine ” he asked gently there was a sudden sense of strain in the atmosphere “if the jewel is where you say it is—well it has been there for over
seven years—a quarter of an hour more does not matter ”
“go on ” said anthony “that wasn’t all you wanted to say ”
“no it was not at this juncture it is—unwise to permit any one
person to leave the room especially if that person has rather
questionable antecedents ”
anthony raised his eyebrows and lighted a cigarette “i suppose a vagabond life is not very respectable ” he mused “two months ago mr cade you were in south africa that is admitted where were you before that ”
anthony leaned back in his chair idly blowing smoke rings “canada wild north west ”
“are you sure you were not in prison a french prison ”
automatically superintendent battle moved a step nearer the door as
if to cut off a retreat that way but anthony showed no signs of doing
anything dramatic instead he stared at the french detective and then burst out laughing “my poor lemoine it is a monomania with you you do indeed see king
victor everywhere so you fancy that i am that interesting gentleman ”
“do you deny it ”
anthony brushed a fleck of ash from his coat sleeve “i never deny anything that amuses me ” he said lightly “but the
accusation is really too ridiculous ”
“ah you think so ” the frenchman leant forward his face was twitching
painfully and yet he seemed perplexed and baffled—as though something
in anthony’s manner puzzled him “what if i tell you monsieur that
this time—this time—i am out to get king victor and nothing shall
stop me ”
“very laudable ” was anthony’s comment “you’ve been out to get him
before though haven’t you lemoine and he’s got the better of you aren’t you afraid that that may happen again he’s a slippery fellow by all accounts ”
the conversation had developed into a duel between the detective and
anthony every one else in the room was conscious of the tension it
was a fight to a finish between the frenchman painfully in earnest and the man who smoked so calmly and whose words seemed to show that he
had not a care in the world “if i were you lemoine ” continued anthony “i should be very very
careful watch your step and all that sort of thing ”
“this time ” said lemoine grimly “there will be no mistake ”
“you seem very sure about it all ” said anthony “but there’s such a
thing as evidence you know ”
lemoine smiled and something in his smile seemed to attract anthony’s
attention he sat up and stubbed out his cigarette “you saw that note i wrote just now ” said the french detective “it
was to my people at the inn yesterday i received from france the
fingerprints and the bertillon measurements of king victor—the
so-called captain o’neill i have asked for them to be sent up to me
here in a few minutes we shall _know_ whether you are the man ”
anthony stared steadily at him then a little smile crept over his face “you’re really rather clever lemoine i never thought of that the
documents will arrive you will induce me to dip my fingers in the ink or something equally unpleasant you will measure my ears and look for
my distinguishing marks and if they agree——”
“well ” said lemoine “if they agree—eh ”
anthony leaned forward in his chair “well if they do agree ” he said very gently “what then ”
“what then ” the detective seemed taken aback “but—i shall have
proved then that you are king victor ”
but for the first time a shade of uncertainty crept into his manner “that will doubtless be a great satisfaction to you ” said anthony “but i don’t quite see where it’s going to hurt me i’m not admitting
anything but supposing just for the sake of argument that i was king
victor—i might be trying to repent you know ”
“repent ”
“that’s the idea put yourself in king victor’s place lemoine use
your imagination you’ve just come out of prison you’re getting on
in life you’ve lost the first fine rapture of the adventurous life say even that you meet a beautiful girl you think of marrying and
settling down somewhere in the country where you can grow vegetable
marrows you decide from henceforth to lead a blameless life put
yourself in king victor’s place can’t you imagine feeling like that ”
“i do not think that i should feel like that ” said lemoine with a
sardonic smile “perhaps you wouldn’t ” admitted anthony “but then you’re not king
victor are you you can’t possibly know what he feels like ”
“but it is nonsense what you are saying there ” spluttered the
frenchman “oh no it isn’t come now lemoine if i’m king victor what have you
against me after all you could never get the necessary evidence in
the old old days remember i’ve served my sentence and that’s all
there is to it i suppose you could arrest me for the french equivalent
of ‘loitering with intent to commit a felony ’ but that would be poor
satisfaction wouldn’t it ”
“you forget ” said lemoine “america how about this business of
obtaining money under false pretences and passing yourself off as
prince nicholas obolovitch ”
“no good lemoine ” said anthony “i was nowhere near america at the
time and i can prove that easily enough if king victor impersonated
prince nicholas in america then i’m not king victor you’re sure he
_was_ impersonated that it wasn’t the man himself ”
superintendent battle suddenly interposed “the man was an impostor all right mr cade ”
“i wouldn’t contradict you battle ” said anthony “you have such a
habit of being always right are you equally sure that prince nicholas
died in the congo ”
battle looked at him curiously “i wouldn’t swear to that sir but it’s generally believed ”
“careful man what’s your motto plenty of rope eh i’ve taken a
leaf out of your book i’ve given m lemoine plenty of rope i’ve not
denied his accusations but all the same i’m afraid he’s going to be
disappointed you see i always believe in having something up one’s
sleeve anticipating that some little unpleasantness might arise here i took the precaution to bring a trump card along with me it—or
rather he—is upstairs ”
“upstairs ” said lord caterham very interested “yes he’s been having rather a trying time of it lately poor fellow got a nasty bump on the head from some one i’ve been looking after
him ”
suddenly the deep voice of mr isaacstein broke in:
“can we guess who he is ”
“if you like ” said anthony “but——”
lemoine interrupted with sudden ferocity:
“all this is foolery you think to outwit me yet again it may be true
what you say—that you were not in america you are too clever to say
it if it were not true but there is something else murder yes murder the murder of prince michael he interfered with you that night
as you were looking for the jewel ”
“lemoine have you ever known king victor to do murder ” anthony’s
voice rang out sharply “you know as well—better than i do that he
has never shed blood ”
“who else but you could have murdered him ” cried lemoine “tell me
that ”
the last word died on his lips as a shrill whistle sounded from the
terrace outside anthony sprang up all his assumed nonchalance laid
aside “you ask me who murdered prince michael ” he cried “i won’t tell
you—i’ll _show_ you that whistle was the signal i’ve been waiting
for the murderer of prince michael is in the library now ”
he sprang out through the window and the others followed him as he led
the way round the terrace until they came to the library window he
pushed the window and it yielded to his touch very softly he held aside the thick velvet curtain so that they could
look into the room standing by the bookcase was a dark figure hurriedly pulling out and
replacing volumes so absorbed in the task that no outside sound was
heeded and then as they stood watching trying to recognize the figure that
was vaguely silhouetted against the light of the electric torch it
carried some one sprang past them with a sound like the roar of a wild
beast the torch fell to the ground was extinguished and the sounds of a
terrific struggle filled the room lord caterham groped his way to the
lights and switched them on two figures were swaying together and as they looked the end came the
short sharp crack of a pistol shot and the smaller figure crumpled up
and fell the other figure turned and faced them—it was boris his
eyes alight with rage “she killed my master ” he growled “now she tries to shoot me i would
have taken the pistol from her and shot her but it went off in the
struggle st michael directed it the evil woman is dead ”
“a woman ” cried george lomax they drew nearer on the floor the pistol still clasped in her hand and an expression of deadly malignity on her face lay—mademoiselle
brun "
Chapter 28,"28
king victor
“i suspected her from the first ” explained anthony “there was a
light in her room on the night of the murder afterwards i wavered i made inquiries about her in brittany and came back satisfied that
she was what she represented herself to be i was a fool because the
comtesse de breteuil had employed a mademoiselle brun and spoke highly
of her it never occurred to me that the real mademoiselle brun might
have been kidnapped on her way to her new post and that it might be
a substitute taking her place instead i shifted my suspicions to mr fish it was not until he had followed me to dover and we had had a
mutual explanation that i began to see clearly once i knew that he was
a pinkerton’s man trailing king victor my suspicions swung back again
to their original object “the thing that worried me most was that mrs revel had definitely
recognized the woman then i remembered that it was only _after_
i had mentioned her being madame de breteuil’s governess and all
she had said was that that accounted for the fact that the woman’s
face was familiar to her superintendent battle will tell you that a
deliberate plot was formed to keep mrs revel from coming to chimneys nothing more nor less than a dead body in fact and though the murder
was the work of the comrades of the red hand punishing supposed
treachery on the part of the victim the staging of it and the absence
of the comrades’ sign manual pointed to some abler intelligence
directing operations from the first i suspected some connection
with herzoslovakia mrs revel was the only member of the house party
who had been to the country i suspected at first that some one was
impersonating prince michael but that proved to be a totally erroneous
idea when i realized the possibility of mademoiselle brun’s being an
impostor and added to that the fact that her face was familiar to mrs revel i began to see daylight it was evidently very important that
she should not be recognized and mrs revel was the only person likely
to do so ”
“but who was she ” said lord caterham “some one mrs revel had known
in herzoslovakia ”
“i think the baron might be able to tell us ” said anthony “i ” the baron stared at him then down at the motionless figure “look well ” said anthony “don’t be put off by the make-up she was an
actress once remember ”
the baron stared again suddenly he started “god in heaven ” he breathed “it is not possible ”
“what is not possible ” asked george “who is the lady you recognize
her baron ”
“no no it is not possible ” the baron continued to mutter “she was
killed they were both killed on the steps of the palace her body was
recovered ”
“mutilated and unrecognizable ” anthony reminded him “she managed to
put up a bluff i think she escaped to america and has spent a good
many years lying low in deadly terror of the comrades of the red hand they promoted the revolution remember and to use an expressive
phrase they always had it in for her then king victor was released and they planned to recover the diamond together she was searching
for it that night when she came suddenly upon prince michael and
he recognized her there was never much fear of her meeting him in
the ordinary way of things royal guests don’t come in contact with
governesses and she could always retire with a convenient _migraine_ as she did the day the baron was here “however she met prince michael face to face when she least expected
it exposure and disgrace stared her in the face she shot him it was
she who placed the revolver in isaacstein’s suit-case so as to confuse
the trail and she who returned the letters ”
lemoine moved forward “she was coming down to search for the jewel that night you say ”
he said “might she not have been going to meet her accomplice king
victor who was coming from outside eh what do you say to that ”
anthony sighed “still at it my dear lemoine how persistent you are you won’t take
my hint that i’ve got a trump card up my sleeve ”
but george whose mind worked slowly now broke in “i am still completely at sea who was this lady baron you recognize
her it seems ”
but the baron drew himself up and stood very straight and stiff “you are in error mr lomax to my knowledge i have not this lady seen
before a complete stranger she is to me ”
“but——”
george stared at him—bewildered the baron took him into a corner of the room and murmured something
into his ear anthony watched with a good deal of enjoyment george’s
face turning slowly purple his eyes bulging and all the incipient
symptoms of apoplexy a murmur of george’s throaty voice came to him “certainly certainly by all means no need at all complicate situation utmost discretion ”
“ah ” lemoine hit the table sharply with his hand “i do not care about
all this the murder of prince michael—that was not my affair i want
king victor ”
anthony shook his head gently “i’m sorry for you lemoine you’re really a very able fellow but all
the same you’re going to lose the trick i’m about to play my trump
card ”
he stepped across the room and rang the bell tredwell answered it “a gentleman arrived with me this evening tredwell ”
“yes sir a foreign gentleman ”
“quite so will you kindly ask him to join us here as soon as possible ”
“yes sir ”
tredwell withdrew “entry of the trump card the mysterious monsieur x ” remarked anthony “_who is he _ can anyone guess ”
“putting two and two together ” said herman isaacstein “what with your
mysterious hints this morning and your attitude this afternoon i
should say there was no doubt about it somehow or other you’ve managed
to get hold of prince nicholas of herzoslovakia ”
“you think the same baron ”
“i do unless yet another impostor you have put forward but that i
will not believe with me your dealings most honourable have been ”
“thank you baron i shan’t forget those words so you are all agreed ”
his eyes swept round the circle of waiting faces only lemoine did not
respond but kept his eyes fixed sullenly on the table anthony’s quick ears had caught the sound of footsteps outside in the
hall “and yet you know ” he said with a queer smile “you’re all wrong ”
he crossed swiftly to the door and flung it open a man stood on the threshold—a man with a neat black beard eyeglasses and a foppish appearance slightly marred by a bandage round
the head “_allow me to present you to the real monsieur lemoine of the sûreté _”
there was a rush and a scuffle and then the nasal tones of mr hiram
fish rose bland and reassuring from the window “no you don’t sonny—not this way i have been stationed here this
whole evening for the particular purpose of preventing your escape you
will observe that i have you covered well and good with this gun of
mine i came over to get you and i’ve got you—but you sure are some
lad ”"
Chapter 29,"29
further explanations
“you owe us an explanation i think mr cade ” said herman isaacstein somewhat later in the evening “there’s nothing much to explain ” said anthony modestly “i went to
dover and fish followed me under the impression that i was king victor we found a mysterious stranger imprisoned there and as soon as we
heard his story we knew where we were the same idea again you see the real man kidnapped and the false one—in this case king victor
himself—takes his place but it seems that battle here always thought
there was something fishy about his french colleague and wired to
paris for his fingerprints and other means of identification ”
“ah ” cried the baron “the fingerprints the bertillon measurements
that that scoundrel talked about ”
“it was a clever idea ” said anthony “i admired it so much that i
felt forced to play up besides my doing so puzzled the false lemoine
enormously you see as soon as i had given the tip about the ‘rows’
and where the jewel really was he was keen to pass on the news to
his accomplice and at the same time to keep us all in that room the
note was really to mademoiselle brun he told tredwell to deliver it
at once and tredwell did so by taking it upstairs to the schoolroom lemoine accused me of being king victor by that means creating a
diversion and preventing anyone from leaving the room by the time all
that had been cleared up and we adjourned to the library to look for
the stone he flattered himself that the stone would be no longer
there to find ”
george cleared his throat “i must say mr cade ” he said pompously “that i consider your
action in that matter highly reprehensible if the slightest hitch had
occurred in your plans one of our national possessions might have
disappeared beyond the hope of recovery it was foolhardy mr cade reprehensibly foolhardy ”
“i guess you haven’t tumbled to the little idea mr lomax ” said the
drawling voice of mr fish “that historic diamond was never behind the
books in the library ”
“never ”
“not on your life ”
“you see ” explained anthony “that little device of count stylptitch’s
stood for what it had originally stood for—a rose when that dawned
upon me on monday afternoon i went straight to the rose garden mr fish had already tumbled to the same idea if standing with your back
to the sundial you take seven paces straight forward then eight to
the left and three to the right you come to some bushes of a bright
red rose called richmond the house has been ransacked to find the
hiding-place but nobody has thought of digging in the garden i
suggest a little digging party to-morrow morning ”
“then the story about the books in the library—”
“an invention of mine to trap the lady mr fish kept watch on the
terrace and whistled when the psychological moment had arrived i may
say that mr fish and i established martial law at the dover house and
prevented the comrades from communicating with the false lemoine he
sent them an order to clear out and word was conveyed to him that this
had been done so he went happily ahead with his plans for denouncing
me ”
“well well ” said lord caterham cheerfully “everything seems to have
been cleared up most satisfactorily ”
“everything but one thing ” said mr isaacstein “what is that ”
the great financier looked steadily at anthony “what did you get me down here for just to assist at a dramatic scene
as an interested onlooker ”
anthony shook his head “no mr isaacstein you are a busy man whose time is money why did
you come down here originally ”
“to negotiate a loan ”
“with whom ”
“prince michael of herzoslovakia ”
“exactly prince michael is dead are you prepared to offer the same
loan on the same terms to his cousin nicholas ”
“can you produce him i thought he was killed in the congo ”
“he was killed all right i killed him oh no i’m not a murderer when i say i killed him i mean that i spread the report of his death i promised you a prince mr isaacstein will _i_ do ”
“you ”
“yes i’m the man nicholas sergius alexander ferdinand obolovitch rather long for the kind of life i proposed to live so i emerged from
the congo as plain anthony cade ”
little captain andrassy sprang up “but this is incredible—incredible ” he spluttered “have a care sir what you say ”
“i can give you plenty of proofs ” said anthony quietly “i think i
shall be able to convince the baron here ”
the baron lifted his hand “your proofs i will examine yes but of them for me there is no need your word alone sufficient for me is besides your english mother you
much resemble all along have i said: ‘this young man on one side or
the other most highly born is’ ”
“you have always trusted my word baron ” said anthony “i can assure
you that in the days to come i shall not forget ”
then he looked over at superintendent battle whose face had remained
perfectly expressionless “you can understand ” said anthony with a smile “that my position
has been extremely precarious of all those in the house i might
be supposed to have the best reason for wishing michael obolovitch
out of the way since i was the next heir to the throne i’ve been
extraordinarily afraid of battle all along i always felt that he
suspected me but that he was held up by lack of motive ”
“i never believed for a minute that you’d shot him sir ” said
superintendent battle “we’ve got a feeling in such matters but i
knew that you were afraid of something and you puzzled me if i’d
known sooner who you really were i dare say i’d have yielded to the
evidence and arrested you ”
“i’m glad i managed to keep one guilty secret from you you wormed
everything else out of me all right you’re a damned good man at your
job battle i shall always think of scotland yard with respect ”
“most amazing ” muttered george “most amazing story i ever heard i—i
can really hardly believe it you are quite sure baron that——”
“my dear mr lomax ” said anthony with a slight hardness in his tone “i have no intention of asking the british foreign office to support
my claim without bringing forward the most convincing documentary
evidence i suggest that we adjourn now and that you the baron mr isaacstein and myself discuss the terms of the proposed loan ”
the baron rose to his feet and clicked his heels together “it will be the proudest moment of my life sir ” he said solemnly “when i see you king of herzoslovakia ”
“oh by the way baron ” said anthony carelessly slipping his hand
through the other’s arm “i forgot to tell you there’s a string tied
to this i’m married you know ”
the baron retreated a step or two dismay overspread his countenance “something wrong i knew there would be ” he boomed “merciful god in
heaven he has married a black woman in africa ”
“come come it’s not so bad as all that ” said anthony laughing “she’s white enough—white all through bless her ”
“good a respectable morganatic affair it can be then ”
“not a bit of it she’s to play queen to my king it’s no use shaking
your head she’s fully qualified for the post she’s the daughter of
an english peer who dates back to the time of the conqueror it’s very
fashionable just now for royalties to marry into the aristocracy—and
she knows something of herzoslovakia ”
“my god ” cried george lomax startled out of his usual careful speech “not—not—virginia revel ”
“yes ” said anthony “virginia revel ”
“my dear fellow ” cried lord caterham “i mean—sir i congratulate
you i do indeed a delightful creature ”
“thank you lord caterham ” said anthony “she’s all you say and more ”
but mr isaacstein was regarding him curiously “you’ll excuse my asking your highness but when did this marriage take
place ”
anthony smiled back at him “as a matter of fact ” he said “i married her this morning ”"

anthony signs on for a new job
“if you will go on gentlemen i will follow you in a minute ” said
anthony he waited whilst the others filed out and then turned to where
superintendent battle was standing apparently absorbed in examining the
panelling “well battle want to ask me something don’t you ”
“well i do sir though i don’t know how you knew i did but i always
marked you out as being specially quick in the uptake i take it that
the lady who is dead was the late queen varaga ”
“quite right battle it’ll be hushed up i hope you can understand
what i feel about family skeletons ”
“trust mr lomax for that sir no one will ever know that is a lot
of people will know but it won’t get about ”
“was that what you wanted to ask me about ”
“no sir—that was only in passing i was curious to know just what
made you drop your own name—if i’m not taking too much of a liberty ”
“not a bit i’ll tell you i killed myself from the purest motives battle my mother was english i’d been educated in england and i
was far more interested in england than in herzoslovakia and i felt
an absolute fool knocking about the world with a comic opera title
tacked on to me you see when i was very young i had democratic
ideas believed in the purity of ideals and the equality of all men i
especially disbelieved in kings and princes ”
“and since then ” asked battle shrewdly “oh since then i’ve travelled and seen the world there’s damned
little equality going about mind you i still believe in democracy but you’ve got to force it on people with a strong hand—ram it down
their throats men don’t want to be brothers—they may some day but
they don’t now my final belief in the brotherhood of man died the day
i arrived in london last week when i observed the people standing
in a tube train resolutely refuse to move up and make room for those
who entered you won’t turn people into angels by appealing to their
better natures just yet awhile—but by judicious force you can coerce
them into behaving more or less decently to one another to go on
with i still believe in the brotherhood of man but it’s not coming
yet awhile say another ten thousand years or so it’s no good being
impatient evolution is a slow process ”
“i’m very interested in these views of yours sir ” said battle with a
twinkle “and if you’ll allow me to say so i’m sure you’ll make a very
fine king out there ”
“thank you battle ” said anthony with a sigh “you don’t seem very happy about it sir ”
“oh i don’t know i dare say it will be rather fun but it’s tying
oneself down to regular work i’ve always avoided that before ”
“but you consider it your duty i suppose sir ”
“good lord no what an idea it’s a woman—it’s always a woman battle i’d do more than be a king for her sake ”
“quite so sir ”
“i’ve arranged it so that the baron and isaacstein can’t kick the one
wants a king and the other wants oil they’ll both get what they want and i’ve got—oh lord battle have you ever been in love ”
“i am much attached to mrs battle sir ”
“much attached to mrs —oh you don’t know what i’m talking about it’s
entirely different ”
“excuse me sir that man of yours is waiting outside the window ”
“boris so he is he’s a wonderful fellow it’s a mercy that pistol
went off in the struggle and killed the lady otherwise boris would
have wrung her neck as sure as fate and then you would have wanted to
hang him his attachment to the obolovitch dynasty is remarkable the
queer thing was that as soon as michael was dead he attached himself to
me—and yet he couldn’t possibly have known who i really was ”
“instinct ” said battle “like a dog ”
“very awkward instinct i thought it at the time i was afraid it might
give the show away to you i suppose i’d better see what he wants ”
he went out through the window superintendent battle left alone looked after him for a minute then apparently addressed the panelling “he’ll do ” said superintendent battle outside boris explained himself “master ” said he and led the way along the terrace anthony followed him wondering what was forward presently boris stopped and pointed with his forefinger it was
moonlight and in front of them was a stone seat on which sat two
figures “he _is_ a dog ” said anthony to himself “and what’s more a pointer ”
he strode forward boris melted into the shadows the two figures rose to meet him one of them was virginia—the
other——
“hullo joe ” said a well remembered voice “this is a great girl of
yours ”
“jimmy mcgrath by all that’s wonderful ” cried anthony “how in the
name of fortune did you get here ”
“that trip of mine into the interior went phut then some dagos came
monkeying round wanted to buy that manuscript off me next thing i as
near as nothing got a knife in the back one night that made me think
that i’d handed you out a bigger job than i knew i thought you might
need help and i came along after you by the very next boat ”
“wasn’t it splendid of him ” said virginia she squeezed jimmy’s arm “why didn’t you ever tell me how frightfully nice he was you are jimmy you’re a perfect dear ”
“you two seem to be getting along all right ” said anthony “sure thing ” said jimmy “i was snooping round for news of you when
i connected with this dame she wasn’t at all what i thought she’d
be—some swell haughty society lady that’d scare the life out of me ”
“he told me all about the letters ” said virginia “and i feel almost
ashamed not to have been in real trouble over them when he was such a
knight-errant ”
“if i’d known what you were like ” said jimmy gallantly “i’d not have
given him the letters i’d have brought them to you myself say young
man is the fun really over is there nothing for me to do ”
“by jove ” said anthony “there is wait a minute ”
he disappeared into the house in a minute or two he returned with a
paper package which he cast into jimmy’s arms “go round to the garage and help yourself to a likely looking car beat
it to london and deliver that parcel at 17 everdean square that’s
mr balderson’s private address in exchange he’ll hand you a thousand
pounds ”
“what it’s not the memoirs i understood that they’d been burnt ”
“what do you take me for ” demanded anthony “you don’t think i’d fall
for a story like that do you i rang up the publishers at once found
out that the other was a fake call and arranged accordingly i made up
a dummy package as i’d been directed to do but i put the real package
in the manager’s safe and handed over the dummy the memoirs have never
been out of my possession ”
“bully for you my son ” said jimmy “oh anthony ” cried virginia “you’re not going to let them be
published ”
“i can’t help myself i can’t let a pal like jimmy down but you
needn’t worry i’ve had time to wade through them and i see now why
people always hint that bigwigs don’t write their own reminiscences
but hire some one to do it for them as a writer stylptitch is an
insufferable bore he proses on about statecraft and doesn’t go in for
any racy and indiscreet anecdotes his ruling passion of secrecy held
strong to the end there’s not a word in the memoirs from beginning to
end to flutter the susceptibilities of the most difficult politician i rang up balderson to-day and arranged with him that i’d deliver the
manuscript to-night before midnight but jimmy can do his own dirty
work now that’s he’s here ”
“i’m off ” said jimmy “i like the idea of that thousand
pounds—especially when i’d made up my mind i was down and out ”
“half a second ” said anthony “i’ve got a confession to make to you virginia something that every one else knows but that i haven’t yet
told you ”
“i don’t mind how many strange women you’ve loved so long as you don’t
tell me about them ”
“women ” said anthony with a virtuous air “women indeed you ask
james here what kind of women i was going about with last time he saw
me ”
“frumps ” said jimmy solemnly “utter frumps not one a day under
forty-five ”
“thank you jimmy ” said anthony “you’re a true friend no it’s much
worse than that i’ve deceived you as to my real name ”
“is it very dreadful ” said virginia with interest “it isn’t
something silly like pobbles is it fancy being called mrs pobbles ”
“you are always thinking the worst of me ”
“i admit that i did once think you were king victor but only for about
a minute and a half ”
“by the way jimmy i’ve got a job for you—gold prospecting in the
rocky fastnesses of herzoslovakia ”
“is there gold there ” asked jimmy eagerly “sure to be ” said anthony “it’s a wonderful country ”
“so you’re taking my advice and going there ”
“yes ” said anthony “your advice was worth more than you knew now
for the confession i wasn’t changed at nurse or anything romantic
like that but nevertheless i am really prince nicholas obolovitch of
herzoslovakia ”
“oh anthony ” cried virginia “how perfectly screaming and i have
married you what are we going to do about it ”
“we’ll go to herzoslovakia and pretend to be kings and queens jimmy
mcgrath once said that the average life of a king or queen out there is
under four years i hope you don’t mind ”
“mind ” cried virginia “i shall love it ”
“isn’t she great ” murmured jimmy then discreetly he faded into the night a few minutes later the
sound of a car was heard “nothing like letting a man do his own dirty work ” said anthony with
satisfaction “besides i didn’t know how else to get rid of him since
we were married i’ve not had one minute alone with you ”
“we’ll have a lot of fun ” said virginia “teaching the brigands not
to be brigands and the assassins not to assassinate and generally
improving the moral tone of the country ”
“i like to hear these pure ideals ” said anthony “it makes me feel my
sacrifice has not been in vain ”
“rot ” said virginia calmly “you’ll enjoy being a king it’s in your
blood you know you were brought up to the trade of royalty and
you’ve got a natural aptitude for it just like plumbers have a natural
bent for plumbing ”
“i never think they have ” said anthony “but damn it all don’t let’s
waste time talking about plumbers do you know that at this very
minute i’m supposed to be deep in conference with isaacstein and old
lollipop they want to talk about oil oil my god they can just
await my kingly pleasure virginia do you remember my telling you once
that i’d have a damned good try to make you care for me ”
“i remember ” said virginia softly “but superintendent battle was
looking out of the window ”
“well he isn’t now ” said anthony he caught her suddenly to him kissing her eyelids her lips the green
gold of her hair “i do love you so virginia ” he whispered “i do love you so do you
love me ”
he looked down at her—sure of the answer her head rested against his shoulder and very low in a sweet shaken
voice she answered:
“not a bit ”
“you little devil ” cried anthony kissing her again “now i know for
certain that i shall love you until i die ”"
Chapter 31,"31
sundry details
scene—chimneys 11 a m thursday morning johnson the police constable with his coat off digging something in the nature of a funeral feeling seems to be in the air the friends and relations stand round the grave that johnson is digging george lomax has the air of the principal beneficiary under the will
of the deceased superintendent battle with his immovable face seems
pleased that the funeral arrangements have gone so nicely as the
undertaker it reflects credit upon him lord caterham has that solemn
and shocked look which englishmen assume when a religious ceremony is
in progress mr fish does not fit into the picture so well he is not sufficiently
grave johnson bends to his task suddenly he straightens up a little stir of
excitement passes round “that’ll do sonny ” says mr fish “we shall do nicely now ”
one perceives at once that he is really the family physician johnson retires mr fish with due solemnity stoops over the
excavation the surgeon is about to operate he brings out a small canvas package with much ceremony he hands it
to superintendent battle the latter in his turn hands it to george
lomax the etiquette of the situation has now been fully complied with george lomax unwraps the package slits up the oil-silk inside it burrows into further wrapping for a moment he holds something on the
palm of his hand—then quickly shrouds it once more in cotton wool he clears his throat “at this auspicious minute ” he begins with the clear delivery of the
practised speaker lord caterham beats a precipitate retreat on the terrace he finds his
daughter “bundle is that car of yours in order ”
“yes why ”
“then take me up to town in it immediately i’m going abroad at
once—to-day ”
“but father——”
“don’t argue with me bundle george lomax told me when he arrived this
morning that he was anxious to have a few words with me privately on a
matter of the utmost delicacy he added that the king of timbuctoo was
arriving in london shortly i won’t go through it again bundle do you
hear not for fifty george lomaxes if chimneys is so valuable to the
nation let the nation buy it otherwise i shall sell it to a syndicate
and they can turn it into an hotel ”
“where is codders now ”
bundle is rising to the situation “at the present minute ” replied lord caterham looking at his watch “he is good for at least fifteen minutes about the empire ”
another picture mr bill eversleigh not invited to be present at the graveside
ceremony at the telephone “no really i mean it i say don’t be huffy well you will
have supper to-night anyway no i haven’t i’ve been kept to it
with my nose at the grindstone you’ve no idea what codders is like i say dolly you know jolly well what i think about you you know
i’ve never cared for anyone but you yes i’ll come to the show
first how does the old wheeze go ‘and the little girl tries hooks
and eyes’ ”
unearthly sounds mr eversleigh trying to hum the refrain in question and now george’s peroration draws to a close “the lasting peace and prosperity of the british empire ”
“i guess ” said mr hiram fish _sotto voce_ to himself and the world at
large “that this has been a great little old week ”
