to this i willingly agreed and an hour later i was sitting opposite
mr havering in a first-class carriage on the midland railway speeding rapidly away from london “to begin with captain hastings you must understand that hunter’s
lodge where we are going and where the tragedy took place is only a
small shooting-box in the heart of the derbyshire moors our real home
is near newmarket and we usually rent a flat in town for the season hunter’s lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable
of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional week-end of
course during the shooting season we take down some of our own
servants from newmarket “my uncle mr harrington pace (as you may know my mother was a miss
pace of new york) has for the last three years made his home with us he never got on well with my father or my elder brother and i
suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather
increased than diminished his affection toward me of course i am a
poor man and my uncle was a rich one—in other words he paid the
piper but though exacting in many ways he was not really hard to get
on with and we all three lived very harmoniously together “two days ago my uncle rather wearied with some recent gayeties of
ours in town suggested that we should run down to derbyshire for a
day or two my wife telegraphed to mrs middleton the housekeeper and we went down that same afternoon yesterday evening i was forced
to return to town but my wife and my uncle remained on this morning
i received this telegram ”
he handed it over to me and i read:
 come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good
 detective if you can but do come zoe “then as yet you know no details ”
“no i suppose it will be in the evening papers without doubt the
police are in charge ”"
Chapter 2,"* * * * *
it was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station of
elmer’s dale from there a five-mile drive brought us to a small gray
stone building in the midst of the rugged moors “a lonely place ” i observed havering nodded “i shall try and get rid of it i could never live here again ”
we unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak
door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us “japp ” i ejaculated the scotland yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before
addressing my companion “mr havering i think i’ve been sent down from london to take charge
of this case and i’d like a word with you if i may sir ”
“my wife——”
“i’ve seen your good lady sir—and the housekeeper i wont keep you a
moment but i’m anxious to get back to the village now that i’ve seen
all there is to see here ”
“i know nothing as yet as to what—”
“ex-actly ” said japp soothingly “but there are just one or two
little points i’d like your opinion about all the same captain
hastings here he knows me and he’ll go on up to the house and tell
them you’re coming ”
i went on to the house i rang the bell as japp had closed the door
behind him after some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged
woman in black “mr havering will be here in a moment ” i explained “he has been
detained by the inspector i have come down with him from london to
look into the case perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last
night ”
“come inside sir ” she closed the door behind me and we stood in the
dimly lighted hall “it was after dinner last night sir that the man
came he asked to see mr pace sir and seeing that he spoke the same
way i thought it was an american gentleman friend of mr pace’s and
i showed him into the gun-room and then went to tell mr pace he
wouldn’t give no name which of course was a bit odd now i come to
think of it “i told mr pace and he seemed puzzled like but he said to the
mistress: ‘excuse me zoe while i just see what this fellow wants ’
he went off to the gun-room and i went back to the kitchen but after
a while i heard loud voices as if they were quarreling and i came
out into the hall at the same time the mistress she comes out too and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence we both
ran to the gun-room door but it was locked and we had to go round to
the window it was open and there inside was mr pace all shot and
bleeding ”
“what became of the man ”
“he must have got away through the window sir before we got to it ”
“and then ”
“mrs havering sent me to fetch the police five miles to walk it
was they came back with me; and the constable he stayed all night;
and this morning the police gentleman from london arrived ”
“what was this man like who called to see mr pace ”
the housekeeper reflected “he had a black beard sir and was about middle-aged and had on a
light overcoat beyond the fact that he spoke like an american i
didn’t notice much about him ”
“i see now i wonder if i can see mrs havering ”
“she’s upstairs sir shall i tell her ”
“if you please tell her that mr havering is outside with inspector
japp and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from london
is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible ”
“very good sir ”"
Chapter 3,"* * * * *
i was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts japp had two
or three hours start of me and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to
be close at his heels mrs havering did not keep me waiting long in a few minutes i heard a
light step descending the stairs and looked up to see a very handsome
young woman coming toward me she wore a flame-colored jumper that
set off the slender boyishness of her figure on her dark head was a
little hat of flame-colored leather even the present tragedy could
not dim the vitality of her personality i introduced myself and she nodded in quick comprehension “of course i have often heard of you and your colleague m poirot you have done some wonderful things together haven’t you it was very
clever of my husband to get you so promptly now will you ask me
questions that is the easiest way isn’t it of getting to know all
you want to about this dreadful affair ”
“thank you mrs havering now what time was it that this man
arrived ”
“it must have been just before nine o’clock we had finished dinner and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes ”
“your husband had already left for london ”
“yes he went up by the six-fifteen ”
“did he go by car to the station or did he walk ”
“our own car isn’t down here one came out from the garage in elmer’s
dale to fetch him in time for the train ”
“was mr pace quite his usual self ”
“absolutely—most normal in every way ”
“now can you describe this visitor at all ”
“i’m afraid not i didn’t see him mrs middleton showed him straight
into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle ”
“what did your uncle say ”
“he seemed rather annoyed but went off at once it was about five
minutes later that i heard the sound of raised voices i ran out into
the hall and almost collided with mrs middleton then we heard the
shot the gun-room door was locked on the inside and we had to go
round the house to the window of course that took some time and the
murderer had been able to get well away my poor uncle”—her voice
faltered—“had been shot through the head i saw at once that he was
dead and i sent mrs middleton for the police straight away i was
careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as i
found it ”"
Chapter 4,"* * * * *
i nodded approval “now as to the weapon ”
“well i can make a guess at it captain hastings a pair of revolvers
of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall one of them is missing i
pointed this out to the police and they took the other one away with
them when they have extracted the bullet i suppose they will know
for certain ”
“may i go to the gun-room ”
“certainly the police have finished with it but the body has been
removed ”
she accompanied me to the scene of the crime at that moment havering
entered the hall and with a quick apology his wife ran to him i was
left to undertake my investigations alone i may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing in
detective-novels clues abound but here i could find nothing that
struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the
carpet where i judged the dead man had fallen i examined everything
with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with
my little camera which i had brought with me i also examined the
ground outside the window but it appeared to have been so heavily
trampled that i judged it was useless to waste time over it now i had
seen all that hunter’s lodge had to show me i must go back to elmer’s
dale and get into touch with japp accordingly i took leave of the
haverings and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from
the station "
Chapter 5,"* * * * *
japp i found at the matlock arms and he took me forthwith to see the
body harrington pace was a small spare cleanshaven man typically
american in appearance he had been shot through the back of the head and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters “turned away for a moment ” remarked japp “and the other fellow
snatched up a revolver and shot him the one mrs havering handed over
to us was fully loaded and i suppose the other one was also curious
what darn fool things people do fancy keeping two loaded revolvers
hanging up on your wall ”
“what do you think of the case ” i asked as we left the gruesome
chamber behind us “well i’d got my eye on havering to begin with oh yes ”—noting
my exclamation of astonishment —“havering has one or two shady
incidents in his past when he was a boy at oxford there was some
funny business about the signature on one of his father’s checks all
hushed up of course then he’s pretty heavily in debt now and
they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about;
whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favor yes i’d got my eye on him and that’s why i wanted to speak to him before
he saw his wife; but their statements dovetail all right and i’ve
been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the
six-fifteen that gets up to london about ten-thirty he went straight
to his club he says and if that’s confirmed all right—why he
couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black
beard ”
“ah yes—i was going to ask you what you thought about that beard ”
japp winked “i think it grew pretty fast—grew in the five miles from elmer’s dale
to hunter’s lodge americans that i’ve met are mostly clean shaven i
questioned the housekeeper first and then her mistress and their
stories agree all right; but i’m sorry mrs havering didn’t get a look
at the fellow she’s a smart woman and she might have noticed
something that would set us on the track ”"
Chapter 6,"* * * * *
i sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to poirot i was
able to add various further items of information before i posted the
letter the bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a
revolver identical in size to the one held by the police furthermore mr havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and
verified and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived
in london by the train in question and thirdly a sensational
development had occurred a city gentleman living at ealing on
crossing haven green to get to the district railway station that
morning had observed a brown paper parcel stuck between the railings opening it he found that it contained a revolver he handed the
parcel over to the local police station and before night it was
proved to be the one we were in search of the fellow to that given us
by mrs havering one bullet had been fired from it all this i added to my report a wire from poirot arrived while i was
at breakfast the following morning:
 of course black-bearded man was not havering only you or
 japp would have such an idea wire me description of
 housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same
 of mrs havering do not waste time taking photographs of
 interiors they are underexposed and not in the least
 artistic it seemed to me that poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious i
also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with
full facilities for handling the case his request for a description
of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply
ridiculous but i complied as well as i a mere man was able to at
eleven a reply wire came from poirot:
 advise japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late dumfounded i took the wire to japp he swore softly under his breath “he’s the goods m poirot if he says so there’s something in it and i hardly noticed the woman i don’t know that i can go so far as
arresting her but i’ll have her watched we’ll go up right away and
take another look at her ”
but it was too late mrs middleton that quiet middle-aged woman who had appeared so normal and respectable had vanished into thin
air her box had been left behind it contained only ordinary wearing
apparel there was no clue in it to her identity or as to her
whereabouts "
Chapter 7,"* * * * *
from mrs havering we elicited all the facts we could “i engaged her about three weeks ago when mrs emery our former
housekeeper left she came to me from mrs selboume’s agency in mount
st —a very well-known place i get all my servants from there they
sent several women to see me but this mrs middleton seemed much the
nicest and had splendid references i engaged her on the spot and
notified the agency of the fact i can’t believe that there was
anything wrong with her she was such a nice quiet woman ”
the thing was certainly a mystery while it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the
crime since at the moment the shot was fired mrs havering was with
her in the hall nevertheless she must have some connection with the
murder or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt i wired the latest development to poirot and suggested returning to
london and making inquiries at selbourne’s agency poirot’s reply was
prompt:
 useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard
 of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunter’s
 lodge when she first arrived there though mystified i was obedient the means of transport in elmer’s
dale were limited the local garage had two cars and there were two
station flies none of these had been requisitioned on the date in
question i may also mention that inquiries at the agency in london
bore out poirot’s prognostication no such woman as “mrs middleton”
had ever been on their books they had received the hon mrs havering’s application for a housekeeper and had sent her various
applicants for the post when she sent them the engagement fee she
omitted to mention which woman she had selected [it is suggested that the reader pause in his perusal of the story
 at this point make his own solution of the mystery—and then see
 how close he comes to that of the author—the editors ]
somewhat crestfallen i returned to london i found poirot established
in an armchair by the fire he greeted me with much affection “_mon ami hastings _ but how glad i am to see you veritably i have
for you a great affection and you have enjoyed yourself you have run
to and fro with the good japp you have interrogated and investigated
to your heart’s content ”
“poirot ” i cried “the thing’s a dark mystery it will never be
solved ”
“it is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over
it ”
“no indeed it’s a hard nut to crack ”
“oh as far as that goes me i am very good at cracking the nuts a
veritable squirrel it is not that which embarrasses me i know well
enough who killed mr harrington pace ”
“you know how did you find out ”
“your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth see here hastings let us examine the facts methodically and in
order mr harrington pace is a man with a considerable fortune which
at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew—point number one his
nephew is known to be desperately hard up—point number two his nephew
is also known to be—shall we say a man of loose moral fiber point
number three ”
“but roger havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to
london ”
“_précisément _ and therefore as mr havering left elmer’s dale at
six-fifteen and since mr pace cannot have been killed before he left
(or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given
wrongly when he examined the body) we conclude quite rightly that
mr havering did _not_ shoot his uncle but there is a mrs havering hastings ”
“impossible the housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired ”
“ah yes the housekeeper but she has disappeared ”
“she will be found ”
“i think not there is something peculiarly elusive about that
housekeeper—don’t you think so it struck me at once ”
“she played her part i suppose and then got out in the nick of
time ”
“and what was her part ”
“well—i presume to admit her confederate the black-bearded man ”
“oh no that was not her part her part was what you have just
mentioned to provide an alibi for mrs havering at the moment the
shot was fired and no one will ever find her _mon ami_ because she
does not exist ‘there’s no sech person ’ as your so great shakespeare
says ”
“it was dickens ” i murmured smiling “but what do you mean poirot ”
“i mean that zoe havering was an actress before her marriage that you
and japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall a dim middle-aged
figure in black with a faint subdued voice and finally that neither
you nor japp nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched ever
saw mrs middleton and her mistress at one and the same time it was a
child’s play for that clever and daring woman on the pretext of
summoning her mistress she runs upstairs slips on a bright jumper
and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the gray
transformation a few deft touches and the make-up is removed; a
slight dusting of rouge and the brilliant zoe havering comes down
with her clear ringing voice ”
“but the revolver that was found at ealing mrs havering could not
have placed it there ”
“no that was roger havering’s job—but it was a mistake on their part it put me on the right track a man who has committed a murder with a
revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once; he
would not carry it up to london with him no the motive was clear;
the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far
removed from derbyshire; they were anxious to get the police away as
soon as possible from the vicinity of hunter’s lodge of course the
revolver found at ealing was not the one with which mr pace was shot roger havering discharged one shot from it brought it up to london went straight to his club to establish his alibi then went quickly
out to ealing by the district railway a matter of about twenty
minutes only placed the parcel where it was found and so back to
town that charming creature his wife quietly shoots mr pace after
dinner—you remember he was shot from behind another significant
point that she reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place and then starts off with her desperate little comedy ”
“it’s incredible ” i murmured fascinated “and yet—”
“and yet it is true _bien sûr_ my friend it is true but to bring
that precious pair to justice that is another matter well japp must
do what he can—i have written him fully; but i very much fear hastings that we shall be obliged to leave them to fate—or _le bon
dieu_—whichever you prefer ”
“the wicked flourish like a green bay tree ” i reminded him “but at a price hastings always at a price _croyez moi_ ”"
Chapter 8,"* * * * *
poirot’s forebodings were confirmed japp though convinced of the
truth of his theory was unable to get together the necessary evidence
to insure a conviction mr pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands
of his murderers nevertheless nemesis did overtake them and when i
read in the paper that the hon roger and mrs havering were among
those killed in the crashing of the air mail to paris i knew that
justice was satisfied [transcriber’s note: this story appeared in the june 1924 issue of
the blue book magazine ]"
