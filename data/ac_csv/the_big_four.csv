Chapter 1,"1 the unexpected guest
i have met people who enjoy a channel crossing; men who can sit calmly
in their deck-chairs and on arrival wait until the boat is moored then gather their belongings together without fuss and disembark personally i can never manage this from the moment i get on board i
feel that the time is too short to settle down to anything i move my
suit-cases from one spot to another and if i go down to the saloon
for a meal i bolt my food with an uneasy feeling that the boat may
arrive unexpectedly whilst i am below perhaps all this is merely a
legacy from one's short leaves in the war when it seemed a matter of
such importance to secure a place near the gangway and to be amongst
the first to disembark lest one should waste precious minutes of one's
three or five days' leave on this particular july morning as i stood by the rail and watched the
white cliffs of dover drawing nearer i marvelled at the passengers
who could sit calmly in their chairs and never even raise their eyes
for the first sight of their native land yet perhaps their case was
different from mine doubtless many of them had only crossed to paris
for the week-end whereas i had spent the last year and a half on a
ranch in the argentine i had prospered there and my wife and i had
both enjoyed the free and easy life of the south american continent nevertheless it was with a lump in my throat that i watched the
familiar shore draw nearer and nearer i had landed in france two days before transacted some necessary
business and was now _en route_ for london i should be there
some months--time enough to look up old friends and one old friend
in particular a little man with an egg-shaped head and green
eyes--hercule poirot i proposed to take him completely by surprise my last letter from the argentine had given no hint of my intended
voyage--indeed that had been decided upon hurriedly as a result
of certain business complications--and i spent many amused moments
picturing to myself his delight and stupefaction on beholding me he i knew was not likely to be far from his headquarters the time
when his cases had drawn him from one end of england to the other was
past his fame had spread and no longer would he allow one case to
absorb all his time he aimed more and more as time went on at being
considered a ""consulting detective""--as much a specialist as a harley
street physician he had always scoffed at the popular idea of the
human bloodhound who assumed wonderful disguises to track criminals and who paused at every footprint to measure it ""no my friend hastings "" he would say; ""we leave that to giraud and
his friends hercule poirot's methods are his own order and method and 'the little gray cells ' sitting at ease in our own arm-chairs we
see the things that these others overlook and we do not jump to the
conclusion like the worthy japp ""
no; there was little fear of finding hercule poirot far afield on arrival in london i deposited my luggage at an hotel and drove
straight on to the old address what poignant memories it brought back
to me i hardly waited to greet my old landlady but hurried up the
stairs two at a time and rapped on poirot's door ""enter then "" cried a familiar voice from within i strode in poirot stood facing me in his arms he carried a small
valise which he dropped with a crash on beholding me ""_mon ami_ hastings "" he cried ""_mon ami_ hastings ""
and rushing forward he enveloped me in a capacious embrace our
conversation was incoherent and inconsequent ejaculations eager
questions incomplete answers messages from my wife explanations as
to my journey were all jumbled up together ""i suppose there's some one in my old rooms "" i asked at last when we
had calmed down somewhat ""i'd love to put up here again with you ""
poirot's face changed with startling suddenness ""_mon dieu _ but what a _chance Ã©pouvantable_ regard around
you my friend ""
for the first time i took note of my surroundings against the wall
stood a vast ark of a trunk of prehistoric design near to it were
placed a number of suit-cases ranged neatly in order of size from
large to small the inference was unmistakable ""you are going away ""
""yes ""
""where to ""
""south america ""
""_what _""
""yes it is a droll farce is it not it is to rio i go and every
day i say to myself i will write nothing in my letters--but oh the
surprise of the good hastings when he beholds me ""
""but when are you going ""
poirot looked at his watch ""in an hour's time ""
""i thought you always said nothing would induce you to make a long sea
voyage ""
poirot closed his eyes and shuddered ""speak not of it to me my friend my doctor he assures me that one
dies not of it--and it is for the one time only; you understand that
never--never shall i return ""
he pushed me into a chair ""come i will tell you how it all came about do you know who is the
richest man in the world richer even than rockefeller abe ryland ""
""the american soap king ""
""precisely one of his secretaries approached me there is some very
considerable as you would call it hocus-pocus going on in connection
with a big company in rio he wished me to investigate matters on the
spot i refused i told him that if the facts were laid before me i would give him my expert opinion but that he professed himself
unable to do i was to be put in possession of the facts only on my
arrival out there normally that would have closed the matter to
dictate to hercule poirot is sheer impertinence but the sum offered
was so stupendous that for the first time in my life i was tempted by
mere money it was a competence--a fortune and there was a second
attraction--_you_ my friend for this last year and a half i
have been a very lonely old man i thought to myself why not i am
beginning to weary of this unending solving of foolish problems i
have achieved sufficient fame let me take this money and settle down
somewhere near my old friend ""
i was quite affected by this token of poirot's regard ""so i accepted "" he continued ""and in an hour's time i must leave to
catch the boat train one of life's little ironies is it not but i
will admit to you hastings that had not the money offered been so
big i might have hesitated for just lately i have begun a little
investigation of my own tell me what is commonly meant by the phrase 'the big four' ""
""i suppose it had its origin at the versailles conference and then
there's the famous 'big four' in the film world and the term is used
by hosts of smaller fry ""
""i see "" said poirot thoughtfully ""i have come across the phrase you understand under certain circumstances where none of those
explanations would apply it seems to refer to a gang of international
criminals or something of that kind; only--""
""only what "" i asked as he hesitated ""only that i fancy that it is something on a large scale just a little
idea of mine nothing more ah but i must complete my packing the
time advances ""
""don't go "" i urged ""cancel your passage and come out on the same boat
with me ""
poirot drew himself up and glanced at me reproachfully ""ah it is that you do not understand i have passed my word you
comprehend--the word of hercule poirot nothing but a matter of life or
death could detain me now ""
""and that's not likely to occur "" i murmured ruefully ""unless at the
eleventh hour 'the door opens and the unexpected guest comes in '""
i quoted the old saw with a slight laugh and then in the pause that
succeeded it we both started as a sound came from the inner room ""what's that "" i cried ""_ma foi _"" retorted poirot ""it sounds very like your 'unexpected
guest' in my bedroom ""
""but how can any one be in there there's no door except into this
room ""
""your memory is excellent hastings now for the deductions ""
""the window but it's a burglar then he must have had a stiff climb of
it--i should say it was almost impossible ""
i had risen to my feet and was striding in the direction of the door
when the sound of a fumbling at the handle from the other side arrested
me the door swung slowly open framed in the doorway stood a man he was
coated from head to foot with dust and mud; his face was thin and
emaciated he stared at us for a moment and then swayed and fell poirot hurried to his side then he looked up and spoke to me ""brandy--quickly ""
i dashed some brandy into a glass and brought it poirot managed to
administer a little and together we raised him and carried him to the
couch in a few minutes he opened his eyes and looked round him with an
almost vacant stare ""what is it you want monsieur "" said poirot the man opened his lips and spoke in a queer mechanical voice ""m hercule poirot 14 farraway street ""
""yes yes; i am he ""
the man did not seem to understand and merely repeated in exactly the
same tone:--
""m hercule poirot 14 farraway street ""
poirot tried him with several questions sometimes the man did not
answer at all; sometimes he repeated the same phrase poirot made a
sign to me to ring up on the telephone ""get dr ridgeway to come round ""
the doctor was in luckily; and as his house was only just round the
corner few minutes elapsed before he came bustling in ""what's all this eh ""
poirot gave a brief explanation and the doctor started examining our
strange visitor who seemed quite unconscious of his presence or ours ""h'm "" said dr ridgeway when he had finished ""curious case ""
""brain fever "" i suggested the doctor immediately snorted with contempt ""brain fever brain fever no such thing as brain fever an invention
of novelists no; the man's had a shock of some kind he's come here
under the force of a persistent idea--to find m hercule poirot 14
farraway street--and he repeats those words mechanically without in the
least knowing what they mean ""
""aphasia "" i said eagerly this suggestion did not cause the doctor to snort quite as violently as
my last one had done he made no answer but handed the man a sheet of
paper and a pencil ""let's see what he'll do with that "" he remarked the man did nothing with it for some moments then he suddenly began to
write feverishly with equal suddenness he stopped and let both paper
and pencil fall to the ground the doctor picked it up and shook his
head ""nothing here only the figure 4 scrawled a dozen times each one
bigger than the last wants to write 14 farraway street i expect it's an interesting case--very interesting can you possibly keep him
here until this afternoon i'm due at the hospital now but i'll come
back this afternoon and make all arrangements about him it's too
interesting a case to be lost sight of ""
i explained poirot's departure and the fact that i proposed to
accompany him to southampton ""that's all right leave the man here he won't get into mischief he's
suffering from complete exhaustion will probably sleep for eight hours
on end i'll have a word with that excellent mrs funnyface of yours and tell her to keep an eye on him ""
and dr ridgeway bustled out with his usual celerity poirot hastily
completed his packing with one eye on the clock ""the time it marches with a rapidity unbelievable come now hastings you cannot say that i have left you with nothing to do a most
sensational problem the man from the unknown who is he what is he ah _sapristi_ but i would give two years of my life to have
this boat go to-morrow instead of to-day there is something here very
curious--very interesting but one must have time--_time_ it may
be days--or even months--before he will be able to tell us what he came
to tell ""
""i'll do my best poirot "" i assured him ""i'll try to be an efficient
substitute ""
""ye-es ""
his rejoinder struck me as being a shade doubtful i picked up the
sheet of paper ""if i were writing a story "" i said lightly ""i should weave this in
with your latest idiosyncrasy and call it _the mystery of the big
four_ "" i tapped the pencilled figures as i spoke and then i started for our invalid roused suddenly from his stupor sat up in his chair and said clearly and distinctly:
""li chang yen ""
he had the look of a man suddenly awakened from sleep poirot made a
sign to me not to speak the man went on he spoke in a clear high
voice and something in his enunciation made me feel that he was
quoting from some written report or lecture ""li chang yen may be regarded as representing the brains of the big
four he is the controlling and motive force i have designated him therefore as number one number two is seldom mentioned by name he is
represented by an 's' with two lines through it--the sign for a dollar;
also by two stripes and a star it may be conjectured therefore that
he is an american subject and that he represents the power of wealth there seems no doubt that number three is a woman and her nationality
french it is possible that she may be one of the sirens of the
_demi-monde_ but nothing is known definitely number four--""
his voice faltered and broke poirot leant forward ""yes "" he prompted eagerly ""number four ""
his eyes were fastened on the man's face some overmastering terror
seemed to be gaining the day; the features were distorted and twisted ""_the destroyer_ "" gasped the man then with a final convulsive
movement he fell back in a dead faint ""_mon dieu _"" whispered poirot ""i was right then i was right ""
""you think-- ""
he interrupted me ""carry him on to the bed in my room i have not a minute to lose if i
would catch my train not that i want to catch it oh that i could
miss it with a clear conscience but i gave my word come hastings ""
leaving our mysterious visitor in the charge of mrs pearson we drove
away and duly caught the train by the skin of our teeth poirot was
alternately silent and loquacious he would sit staring out of the
window like a man lost in a dream apparently not hearing a word that
i said to him then reverting to animation suddenly he would shower
injunctions and commands upon me and urge the necessity of constant
marconigrams we had a long fit of silence just after we passed woking the train of course did not stop anywhere until southampton; but just here it
happened to be held up by a signal ""ah _sacrÃ© mille tonnerres _"" cried poirot suddenly ""but i have
been an imbecile i see clearly at last it is undoubtedly the blessed
saints who stopped the train jump hastings but jump i tell you ""
in an instant he had unfastened the carriage door and jumped out on
the line ""throw out the suit-cases and jump yourself ""
i obeyed him just in time as i alighted beside him the train moved
on ""and now poirot "" i said in some exasperation ""perhaps you will tell
me what all this is about ""
""it is my friend that i have seen the light ""
""that "" i said ""is very illuminating to me ""
""it should be "" said poirot ""but i fear--i very much fear that it is
not if you can carry two of these valises i think i can manage the
rest """
Chapter 2,"2 the man from the asylum
fortunately the train had stopped near a station a short walk brought
us to a garage where we were able to obtain a car and half an hour
later we were spinning rapidly back to london then and not till then did poirot deign to satisfy my curiosity ""you do not see no more did i but i see now hastings _i was being
got out of the way_ ""
""what ""
""yes very cleverly both the place and the method were chosen with
great knowledge and acumen they were afraid of me ""
""who were ""
""those four geniuses who have banded themselves together to work
outside the law a chinaman an american a frenchwoman and--another pray the good god we arrive back in time hastings ""
""you think there is danger to our visitor ""
""i am sure of it ""
mrs pearson greeted us on arrival brushing aside her ecstasies of
astonishment on beholding poirot we asked for information it was
reassuring no one had called and our guest had not made any sign with a sigh of relief we went up to the rooms poirot crossed the outer
one and went through to the inner one then he called me his voice
strangely agitated ""hastings he's dead ""
i came running to join him the man was lying as we had left him but
he was dead and had been dead some time i rushed out for a doctor ridgeway i knew would not have returned yet i found one almost
immediately and brought him back with me ""he's dead right enough poor chap tramp you've been befriending eh ""
""something of the kind "" said poirot evasively ""what was the cause of
death doctor ""
""hard to say might have been some kind of fit there are signs of
asphyxiation no gas laid on is there ""
""no electric light--nothing else ""
""and both windows wide open too been dead about two hours i should
say you'll notify the proper people won't you ""
he took his departure poirot did some necessary telephoning finally somewhat to my surprise he rang up our old friend inspector japp and
asked him if he could possibly come round no sooner were these proceedings completed than mrs pearson appeared her eyes as round as saucers ""there's a man here from 'anwell--from the 'sylum did you ever shall
i show him up ""
we signified assent and a big burly man in uniform was ushered in ""'morning gentlemen "" he said cheerfully ""i've got reason to believe
you've got one of my birds here escaped last night he did ""
""he was here "" said poirot quietly ""not got away again has he "" asked the keeper with some concern ""he is dead ""
the man looked more relieved than otherwise ""you don't say so well i dare say it's best for all parties ""
""was he--dangerous ""
""'omicidal d'you mean oh no 'armless enough persecution mania very
acute full of secret societies from china that had got him shut up they're all the same ""
i shuddered ""how long had he been shut up "" asked poirot ""a matter of two years now ""
""i see "" said poirot quietly ""it never occurred to anybody that he
might--be sane ""
the keeper permitted himself to laugh ""if he was sane what would he be doing in a lunatic asylum they all
_say_ they're sane you know ""
poirot said no more he took the man in to see the body the
identification came immediately ""that's him--right enough "" said the keeper callously; ""funny sort
of bloke ain't he well gentlemen i had best go off now and make
arrangements under the circumstances we won't trouble you with the
corpse much longer if there's a hinquest you will have to appear at
it i dare say good morning sir ""
with a rather uncouth bow he shambled out of the room a few minutes later japp arrived the scotland yard inspector was
jaunty and dapper as usual ""here i am moosior poirot what can i do for you thought you were off
to the coral strands of somewhere or other to-day ""
""my good japp i want to know if you have ever seen this man before ""
he led japp into the bedroom the inspector stared down at the figure
on the bed with a puzzled face ""let me see now--he seems sort of familiar--and i pride myself on my
memory too why god bless my soul it's mayerling ""
""and who is--or was--mayerling ""
""secret service chap--not one of our people went to russia five years
ago never heard of again always thought the bolshies had done him in ""
""it all fits in "" said poirot when japp had taken his leave ""except
for the fact that he seems to have died a natural death ""
he stood looking down on the motionless figure with a dissatisfied
frown a puff of wind set the window-curtains flying out and he looked
up sharply ""i suppose you opened the windows when you laid him down on the bed hastings ""
""no i didn't "" i replied ""as far as i remember they were shut ""
poirot lifted his head suddenly ""shut--and now they are open what can that mean ""
""somebody came in that way "" i suggested ""possibly "" agreed poirot but he spoke absently and without
conviction after a minute or two he said:
""that is not exactly the point i had in mind hastings if only one
window was open it would not intrigue me so much it is both windows
being open that strikes me as curious ""
he hurried into the other room ""the sitting-room window is open too that also we left shut ah ""
he bent over the dead man examining the corners of the mouth minutely then he looked up suddenly ""he has been gagged hastings gagged and then poisoned ""
""good heavens "" i exclaimed shocked ""i suppose we shall find out all
about it from the post-mortem ""
""we shall find out nothing he was killed by inhaling strong prussic
acid it was jammed right under his nose then the murderer went away
again first opening all the windows hydrocyanic acid is exceedingly
volatile but it has a pronounced smell of bitter almonds with no
trace of the smell to guide them and no suspicion of foul play death
would be put down to some natural cause by the doctors so this man was
in the secret service hastings and five years ago he disappeared in
russia ""
""the last two years he's been in the asylum "" i said ""but what of the
three years before that ""
poirot shook his head and then caught my arm ""the clock hastings look at the clock ""
i followed his gaze to the mantelpiece the clock had stopped at four
o'clock ""_mon ami_ some one has tampered with it it had still three days
to run it is an eight-day clock you comprehend ""
""but what should they want to do that for some idea of a false scent
by making the crime appear to have taken place at four o'clock ""
""no no; rearrange your ideas mon ami exercise your little gray
cells you are mayerling you hear something perhaps--and you know
well enough that your doom is sealed you have just time to leave a
sign _four_ o'clock hastings number four the _destroyer_ ah an idea ""
he rushed into the other room and seized the telephone he asked for
hanwell ""you are the asylum yes i understand there has been an escape to-day what is that you say a little moment if you please will you repeat
that ah _parfaitement_ ""
he hung up the receiver and turned to me ""you heard hastings _there has been no escape _""
""but the man who came--the keeper "" i said ""i wonder--i very much wonder ""
""you mean-- ""
""number four--the destroyer ""
i gazed at poirot dumbfounded a minute or two after on recovering my
voice i said:--
""we shall know him again anywhere that's one thing he was a man of
very pronounced personality ""
""was he _mon ami_ i think not he was burly and bluff and
red-faced with a thick moustache and a hoarse voice he will
be none of those things by this time and for the rest he has
nondescript eyes nondescript ears and a perfect set of false teeth identification is not such an easy matter as you seem to think next
time--""
""you think there will be a next time "" i interrupted poirot's face grew very grave ""it is a duel to the death _mon ami_ you and i on the one side the big four on the other they have won the first trick; but they have
failed in their plan to get me out of the way and in the future they
have to reckon with hercule poirot """
Chapter 3,"3 we hear more about li chang yen
for a day or two after our visit from the fake asylum attendant i was
in some hopes that he might return and i refused to leave the flat
even for a moment as far as i could see he had no reason to suspect
that we had penetrated his disguise he might i thought return and
try to remove the body but poirot scoffed at my reasoning ""_mon ami_ "" he said ""if you wish you may wait in to put salt on
the little bird's tail but for me i do not waste my time so ""
""well then poirot "" i argued ""why did he run the risk of coming
at all if he intended to return later for the body i can see some
point in his visit he would at least be removing the evidence against
himself; as it is he does not seem to have gained anything ""
poirot shrugged his most gallic shrug ""but you do not see with the
eyes of number four hastings "" he said ""you talk of evidence but
what evidence have we against him true we have a body but we have
no proof even that the man was murdered--prussic acid when inhaled leaves no trace again we can find no one who saw any one enter the
flat during our absence and we have found out nothing about the
movements of our late friend mayerling ""no hastings number four has left no trace and he knows it his
visit we may call a reconnaissance perhaps he wanted to make quite
sure that mayerling was dead but more likely i think he came to see
hercule poirot and to have speech with the adversary whom alone he
must fear ""
poirot's reasoning appeared to me typically egotistical but i forbore
to argue ""and what about the inquest "" i asked ""i suppose you will explain
things clearly there and let the police have a full description of
number four ""
""and to what end can we produce anything to impress a coroner's jury
of your solid britishers is our description of number four of any
value no; we shall allow them to call it 'accidental death ' and may
be although i have not much hope our clever murderer will pat himself
on the back that he deceived hercule poirot in the first round ""
poirot was right as usual we saw no more of the man from the asylum and the inquest at which i gave evidence but which poirot did not
even attend aroused no public interest as in view of his intended trip to south america poirot had wound up
his affairs before my arrival he had at this time no cases on hand but although he spent most of his time in the flat i could get little
out of him he remained buried in an arm-chair and discouraged my
attempts at conversation and then one morning about a week after the murder he asked me if
i would care to accompany him on a visit he wished to make i was
pleased for i felt he was making a mistake in trying to work things
out so entirely on his own and i wished to discuss the case with him but i found he was not communicative even when i asked where we were
going he would not answer poirot loves being mysterious he will never part with a piece
of information until the last possible moment in this instance having taken successively a 'bus and two trains and arrived in the
neighbourhood of one of london's most depressing southern suburbs he
consented at last to explain matters ""we go hastings to see the one man in england who knows most of the
underground life of china ""
""indeed who is he ""
""a man you have never heard of--a mr john ingles to all intents and
purposes he is a retired civil servant of mediocre intellect with
a house full of chinese curios with which he bores his friends and
acquaintances nevertheless i am assured by those who should know that
the only man capable of giving me the information i seek is this same
john ingles ""
a few moments more saw us ascending the steps of the laurels as mr ingles's residence was called personally i did not notice a laurel
bush of any kind so deduced that it had been named according to the
usual obscure nomenclature of the suburbs we were admitted by an impassive-faced chinese servant and ushered
into the presence of his master mr ingles was a squarely-built man somewhat yellow of countenance with deep-set eyes that were oddly
reflective in character he rose to greet us setting aside an open
letter which he had held in his hand he referred to it after his
greeting ""sit down won't you halsey tells me that you want some information
and that i may be useful to you in the matter ""
""that is so monsieur i ask of you if you have any knowledge of a man
named li chang yen ""
""that's rum--very rum indeed how did you come to hear about the man ""
""you know him then ""
""i've met him once and i know something of him--not quite as much as i
should like to but it surprises me that any one else in england should
even have heard of him he's a great man in his way--mandarin class and
all that you know--but that's not the crux of the matter there's good
reason to suppose that he's the man behind it all ""
""behind what ""
""everything the world-wide unrest the labour troubles that beset
every nation and the revolutions that break out in some there are
people not scaremongers who know what they are talking about and
they say that there is a force behind the scenes which aims at nothing
less than the disintegration of civilisation in russia you know there were many signs that lenin and trotsky were mere puppets whose
every action was dictated by another's brain i have no definite proof
that would count with you but i am quite convinced that this brain
was li chang yen's ""
""oh come "" i protested ""isn't that a bit farfetched how would a
chinaman cut any ice in russia ""
poirot frowned at me irritably ""for you hastings "" he said ""everything is farfetched that comes not
from your own imagination; for me i agree with this gentleman but
continue i pray monsieur ""
""what exactly he hopes to get out of it all i cannot pretend to say
for certain "" went on mr ingles; ""but i assume his disease is one
that has attacked great brains from the time of akbar and alexander to
napoleon--a lust for power and personal supremacy up to modern times
armed force was necessary for conquest but in this century of unrest
a man like li chang yen can use other means i have evidence that he
has unlimited money behind him for bribery and propaganda and there
are signs that he controls some scientific force more powerful than the
world has dreamed of ""
poirot was following mr ingles's words with the closest attention ""and in china "" he asked ""he moves there too ""
the other nodded in emphatic assent ""there "" he said ""although i can produce no proof that would count in
a court of law i speak from my own knowledge i know personally every
man who counts for anything in china to-day and this i can tell you:
the men who loom most largely in the public eye are men of little or
no personality they are marionettes who dance to the wires pulled by
a master hand and that hand is li chang yen's his is the controlling
brain of the east to-day we don't understand the east--we never shall;
but li chang yen is its moving spirit not that he comes out into the
limelight--oh not at all; he never moves from his palace in pekin but
he pulls strings--that's it pulls strings--and things happen far away ""
""and is there no one to oppose him "" asked poirot mr ingles leant forward in his chair ""four men have tried in the last four years "" he said slowly; ""men of
character and honesty and brain power any one of them might in time
have interfered with his plans "" he paused ""well "" i queried ""well they are dead one wrote an article and mentioned li chang
yen's name in connection with the riots in pekin and within two days
he was stabbed in the street his murderer was never caught the
offences of the other two were similar in a speech or an article or in conversation each linked li chang yen's name with rioting or
revolution and within a week of his indiscretion each was dead one
was poisoned; one died of cholera an isolated case--not part of an
epidemic; and one was found dead in his bed the cause of the last
death was never determined but i was told by a doctor who saw the
corpse that it was burnt and shrivelled as though a wave of electrical
energy of incredible power had passed through it ""
""and li chang yen "" inquired poirot ""naturally nothing is traced to
him but there are signs eh ""
mr ingles shrugged ""oh signs--yes certainly and once i found a man who would talk a
brilliant young chinese chemist who was a protÃ©gÃ© of li chang yen's he came to me one day this chemist and i could see that he was on
the verge of a nervous breakdown he hinted to me of experiments on
which he'd been engaged in li chang yen's palace under the mandarin's
direction--experiments on coolies in which the most revolting disregard
for human life and suffering had been shown his nerve had completely
broken and he was in the most pitiable state of terror i put him to
bed in a top room of my own house intending to question him the next
day--and that of course was stupid of me ""
""how did they get him "" demanded poirot ""that i shall never know i woke that night to find my house in flames and was lucky to escape with my life investigation showed that a fire
of amazing intensity had broken out on the top floor and the remains
of my young chemist friend were charred to a cinder ""
i could see from the earnestness with which he had been speaking that
mr ingles was a man mounted on his hobby horse and evidently he too realised that he had been carried away for he laughed apologetically ""but of course "" he said ""i have no proofs and you like the others will merely tell me that i have a bee in my bonnet ""
""on the contrary "" said poirot quietly ""we have every reason to
believe your story we ourselves are more than a little interested in
li chang yen ""
""very odd your knowing about him didn't fancy a soul in england had
ever heard of him i'd rather like to know how you did come to hear of
him--if it's not indiscreet ""
""not in the least monsieur a man took refuge in my rooms he was
suffering badly from shock but he managed to tell us enough to
interest us in this li chang yen he described four people--the big
four--an organisation hitherto undreamed of number one is li chang
yen number two is an unknown american number three an equally
unknown frenchwoman number four may be called the executive of the
organisation--_the destroyer_ my informant died tell me monsieur is that phrase known to you at all the big four ""
""not in connection with li chang yen no i can't say it is but i've
heard it or read it just lately--and in some unusual connection too ah i've got it ""
he rose and went across to an inlaid lacquer cabinet--an exquisite
thing as even i could see he returned with a letter in his hand ""here you are note from an old sea-faring man i ran against once in
shanghai hoary old reprobate--maudlin with drink by now i should say i took this to be the ravings of alcoholism ""
he read it aloud:--
 ""dear sir --you may not remember me but you did me a good
 turn once in shanghai do me another now i must have money to get
 out of the country i'm well hid here i hope but any day they may
 get me the big four i mean it's life or death i've plenty of
 money but i daren't get at it for fear of putting them wise send
 me a couple of hundred in notes i'll repay it faithful--i swear to
 that --your servant sir ""jonathan whalley ""
""dated from granite bungalow hoppaton dartmoor i'm afraid i regarded
it as rather a crude method of relieving me of a couple of hundred
which i can ill spare if it's any use to you--"" he held it out ""_je vous remercie_ monsieur i start for hoppaton _Ã  l'heure
mÃªme _""
""dear me this is very interesting supposing i come along too any
objection ""
""i should be charmed to have your company but we must start at once we shall not reach dartmoor until close on nightfall as it is ""
john ingles did not delay us more than a couple of minutes and soon
we were in the train moving out of paddington bound for the west
country hoppaton was a small village clustering in a hollow right on
the fringe of the moorland it was reached by a nine-mile drive from
moretonhamstead it was about eight o'clock when we arrived; but as the
month was july the daylight was still abundant we drove into the narrow street of the village and then stopped to ask
our way of an old rustic ""granite bungalow "" said the old man reflectively ""it be granite
bungalow you do want eh ""
we assured him that this was what we did want the old man pointed to a small gray cottage at the end of the street ""there be t'bungalow do yee want to see t'inspector ""
""what inspector "" asked poirot sharply; ""what do you mean ""
""haven't yee heard about t'murder then a shocking business t'was
seemingly pools of blood they do say ""
""_mon dieu _"" murmured poirot ""this inspector of yours i must
see him at once ""
five minutes later we were closeted with inspector meadows the
inspector was inclined to be stiff at first but at the magic name of
inspector japp of scotland yard he unbent ""yes sir; murdered this morning a shocking business they 'phoned to
moreton and i came out at once looked a mysterious thing to begin
with the old man--he was about seventy you know and fond of his
glass from all i hear--was lying on the floor of the living-room there was a bruise on his head and his throat was cut from ear to ear blood all over the place as you can understand the woman who cooks
for him betsy andrews she told us that her master had several little
chinese jade figures that he'd told her were very valuable and these
had disappeared that of course looked like assault and robbery;
but there were all sorts of difficulties in the way of that solution the old fellow had two people in the house; betsy andrews who is a
hoppaton woman and a rough kind of man-servant robert grant grant
had gone to the farm to fetch the milk which he does every day and
betsy had stepped out to have a chat with a neighbour she was only
away twenty minutes--between ten and half-past--and the crime must
have been done then grant returned to the house first he went in by
the back door which was open--no one locks up doors round here--not
in broad daylight at all events--put the milk in the larder and went
into his own room to read the paper and have a smoke had no idea
anything unusual had occurred--at least that's what he says then
betsy comes in goes into the living-room sees what's happened and
lets out a screech to wake the dead that's all fair and square some
one got in whilst those two were out and did the poor old man in but
it struck me at once that he must be a pretty cool customer he'd have
to come right up the village street or creep through some one's back
yard granite bungalow has got houses all round it as you can see how
was it that no one had seen him ""
the inspector paused with a flourish ""aha i perceive your point "" said poirot ""to continue ""
""well sir fishy i said to myself--fishy and i began to look about
me those jade figures now would a common tramp ever suspect that
they were valuable anyway it was madness to try such a thing in
broad daylight suppose the old man had yelled for help ""
""i suppose inspector "" said mr ingles ""that the bruise on the head
was inflicted before death ""
""quite right sir first knocked him silly the murderer did and then
cut his throat that's clear enough but how the dickens did he come
or go they notice strangers quick enough in a little place like this it came to me all at once--nobody did come i took a good look round it had rained the night before and there were footprints clear enough
going in and out of the kitchen in the living-room there were two sets
of footprints only (betsy andrews' stopped at the door)---mr whalley's
(he was wearing carpet slippers) and another man's the other man had
stepped in the blood-stains and i traced his bloody footprints--i beg
your pardon sir ""
""not at all "" said mr ingles with a faint smile; ""the adjective is
perfectly understood ""
""i traced them to the kitchen--but not beyond point number one on
the lintel of robert grant's door was a faint smear--a smear of blood that's point number two point number three was when i got hold of
grant's boots--which he had taken off--and fitted them to the marks that settled it it was an inside job i warned grant and took him into
custody; and what do you think i found packed away in his portmanteau the little jade figures and a ticket-of-leave robert grant was also
abraham biggs convicted for felony and housebreaking five years ago ""
the inspector paused triumphantly ""what do you think of that gentlemen ""
""i think "" said poirot ""that it appears a very clear case--of a
surprising clearness in fact this biggs or grant he must be a man
very foolish and uneducated eh ""
""oh he is that--a rough common sort of fellow no idea of what a
footprint may mean ""
""clearly he reads not the detective fiction well inspector i
congratulate you we may look at the scene of the crime yes ""
""i'll take you there myself this minute i'd like you to see those
footprints ""
""i too should like to see them yes yes very interesting very
ingenious ""
we set out forthwith mr ingles and the inspector forged ahead i
drew poirot back a little so as to be able to speak to him out of the
inspector's hearing ""what do you really think poirot is there more in this than meets the
eye ""
""that is just the question _mon ami_ whalley says plainly enough
in his letter that the big four are on his track and we know you
and i that the big four is no bogey for the children yet everything
seems to say that this man grant committed the crime why did he do so for the sake of the little jade figures or is he an agent of the big
four i confess that this last seems more likely however valuable the
jade a man of that class was not likely to realise the fact--at any
rate not to the point of committing murder for them (that _par
exemple_ ought to have struck the inspector ) he could have stolen
the jade and made off with it instead of committing a brutal and quite
purposeless murder ah yes; i fear our devonshire friend has not used
his little gray cells he has measured footprints and has omitted to
reflect and arrange his ideas with the necessary order and method """
Chapter 4,"4 the importance of a leg of mutton
the inspector drew a key from his pocket and unlocked the door of
granite bungalow the day had been fine and dry so our feet were not
likely to leave any prints; nevertheless we wiped them carefully on
the mat before entering a woman came up out of the gloom and spoke to the inspector and he
turned aside then he spoke over his shoulder ""have a good look round mr poirot and see all there is to be seen i'll be back in about ten minutes by the way here's grant's boot i
brought it along with me for you to compare the impressions ""
we went into the living-room and the sound of the inspector's
footsteps died away outside ingles was attracted immediately by some
chinese curios on a table in the corner and went over to examine them he seemed to take no interest in poirot's doings i on the other
hand watched him with breathless interest the floor was covered with
a dark-green linoleum which was ideal for showing up footprints a
door at the farther end led into the small kitchen from there another
door led into the scullery (where the back door was situated) and
another into the bedroom which had been occupied by robert grant having explored the ground poirot commented upon it in a low running
monologue ""here is where the body lay; that big dark stain and the splashes all
around mark the spot traces of carpet slippers and 'number nine'
boots you observe but all very confused then two sets of tracks
leading to and from the kitchen; whoever the murderer was he came in
that way you have the boot hastings give it to me "" he compared it
carefully with the prints ""yes both made by the same man robert
grant he came in that way killed the old man and went back to the
kitchen he had stepped in the blood; see the stains he left as he
went out nothing to be seen in the kitchen--all the village has been
walking about in it he went into his own room--no first he went
back again to the scene of the crime--was that to get the little jade
figures or had he forgotten something that might incriminate him ""
""perhaps he killed the old man the second time he went in "" i suggested ""_mais non_ you do not observe on one of the outgoing footmarks
stained with blood there is superimposed an ingoing one i wonder what
he went back for--the little jade figures as an afterthought it is
all ridiculous--stupid ""
""well he's given himself away pretty hopelessly ""
""_n'est-ce pas _ i tell you hastings it goes against reason it offends my little gray cells let us go into his bedroom--ah yes; there is the smear of blood on the lintel and just a trace of
footmarks--the blood-stained robert grant's footmarks and his only near the body--robert grant the only man who went near the house yes it must be so ""
""what about the old woman "" i said suddenly ""she was in the house
alone after grant had gone for the milk she might have killed him
and then gone out her feet would leave no prints if she hadn't been
outside ""
""very good hastings i wondered whether that hypothesis would occur
to you i had already thought of it and rejected it betsy andrews is
a local woman well-known hereabouts she can have no connection with
the big four; and besides old whalley was a powerful fellow by all
accounts this is a man's work--not a woman's ""
""i suppose the big four couldn't have had some diabolical contrivance
concealed in the ceiling--something which descended automatically and
cut the old man's throat and was afterwards drawn up again ""
""like jacob's ladder i know hastings that you have an imagination of
the most fertile--but i implore of you to keep it within bounds ""
i subsided abashed poirot continued to wander about poking into
rooms and cupboards with a profoundly dissatisfied expression on his
face suddenly he uttered an excited yelp reminiscent of a pomeranian
dog i rushed to join him he was standing in the larder in a dramatic
attitude in his hand he was brandishing a leg of mutton ""my dear poirot "" i cried ""what is the matter have you suddenly gone
mad ""
""regard i pray you this mutton but regard it closely ""
i regarded it as closely as i could but could see nothing unusual
about it it seemed to me a very ordinary leg of mutton i said as
much poirot threw me a withering glance ""but do you not see this--and this--and this--""
he illustrated each ""this"" with a jab at the unoffending joint dislodging small icicles as he did so poirot had just accused me of being imaginative but i now felt that
he was far more wildly so than i had ever been did he seriously think
these slivers of ice were crystals of a deadly poison that was the
only construction i could put upon his extraordinary agitation ""it's frozen meat "" i explained gently ""imported you know new
zealand ""
he stared at me for a moment or two and then broke into a strange laugh ""how marvellous is my friend hastings he knows everything--but
everything how do they say--inquire within upon everything that is my
friend hastings ""
he flung down the leg of mutton onto its dish again and left the
larder then he looked through the window ""here comes our friend the inspector it is well i have seen all i
want to see here "" he drummed on the table absent-mindedly as though
absorbed in calculation and then asked suddenly ""what is the day of
the week _mon ami_ ""
""monday "" i said rather astonished ""what-- ""
""ah monday is it a bad day of the week to commit a murder on a
monday is a mistake ""
passing back to the living-room he tapped the glass on the wall and
glanced at the thermometer ""set fair and seventy degrees fahrenheit an orthodox english summer's
day ""
ingles was still examining various pieces of chinese pottery ""you do not take much interest in this inquiry monsieur "" said poirot the other gave a slow smile ""it's not my job you see i'm a connoisseur of some things but not
of this so i just stand back and keep out of the way i've learnt
patience in the east ""
the inspector came bustling in apologising for having been so long
away he insisted on taking us over most of the ground again but
finally we got away ""i must appreciate your thousand politenesses inspector "" said poirot as we were walking down the village street again ""there is just one
more request i should like to put to you ""
""you want to see the body perhaps sir ""
""oh dear me no i have not the least interest in the body i want to
see robert grant ""
""you'll have to drive back with me to moreton to see him sir ""
""very well i will do so but i must see him and be able to speak to
him alone ""
the inspector caressed his upper lip ""well i don't know about that sir ""
""i assure you that if you can get through to scotland yard you will
receive full authority ""
""i've heard of you of course sir and i know you've done us a good
turn now and again but it's very irregular ""
""nevertheless it is necessary "" said poirot calmly ""it is necessary
for this reason--grant is not the murderer ""
""what who is then ""
""the murderer was i should fancy a youngish man he drove up
to granite bungalow in a trap which he left outside he went
in committed the murder came out and drove away again he was
bare-headed and his clothing was slightly blood-stained ""
""but--but the whole village would have seen him ""
""not under certain circumstances ""
""not if it was dark perhaps; but the crime was committed in broad
daylight ""
poirot merely smiled ""and the horse and trap sir--how could you tell that any amount of
wheeled vehicles have passed along outside there's no mark of one in
particular to be seen ""
""not with the eyes of the body perhaps; but with the eyes of the mind yes ""
the inspector touched his forehead significantly with a grin at me i
was utterly bewildered but i had faith in poirot further discussion
ended in our all driving back to moreton with the inspector poirot
and i were taken to grant but a constable was to be present during the
interview poirot went straight to the point ""grant i know you to be innocent of this crime relate to me in your
own words exactly what happened ""
the prisoner was a man of medium height with a somewhat unpleasing
cast of features he looked a jail-bird if ever a man did ""honest to god i never did it "" he whined ""some one put those little
glass figures amongst my traps it was a frame-up that's what it was i went straight to my rooms when i came in like i said i never knew a
thing till betsy screeched out s'welp me god i didn't ""
poirot rose ""if you can't tell me the truth that is the end of it ""
""but guv'nor--""
""you _did_ go into the room--you _did_ know your master was
dead; and you were just preparing to make a bolt of it when the good
betsy made her terrible discovery ""
the man stared at poirot with a dropped jaw ""come now is it not so i tell you solemnly--on my word of
honour--that to be frank now is your only chance ""
""i'll risk it "" said the man suddenly ""it was just as you say i came
in and went straight to the master--and there he was dead on the
floor and blood all round then i got the wind up proper they'd ferret
out my record and for a certainty they'd say it was me as had done him
in my only thought was to get away--at once--before he was found--""
""and the jade figures ""
the man hesitated ""you see--""
""you took them by a kind of reversion to instinct as it were you had
heard your master say that they were valuable and you felt you might
as well go the whole hog that i understand now answer me this was it the second time that you went into the room that you took the
figures ""
""i didn't go in a second time once was enough for me ""
""you are sure of that ""
""absolutely certain ""
""good now when did you come out of prison ""
""two months ago ""
""how did you obtain this job ""
""through one of them prisoners' help societies bloke met me when i
came out ""
""what was he like ""
""not exactly a parson but looked like one soft black hat and mincing
way of talking got a broken front tooth spectacled chap saunders his
name was said he hoped i was repentant and that he'd find me a good
post i went to old whalley on his recommendation ""
poirot rose once more ""i thank you i know all now have patience "" he paused in the doorway
and added: ""saunders gave you a pair of boots didn't he ""
grant looked very astonished ""why yes he did but how did you know ""
""it is my business to know things "" said poirot gravely after a word or two to the inspector the three of us went to the white
hart and discussed eggs and bacon and devonshire cider ""any elucidations yet "" asked ingles with a smile ""yes the case is clear enough now; but see you i shall have a good
deal of difficulty in proving it whalley was killed by order of the
big four--but not by grant a very clever man got grant the post
and deliberately planned to make him the scapegoat--an easy matter
with grant's prison record he gave him a pair of boots one of two
duplicate pairs the other he kept himself it was all so simple when
grant is out of the house and betsy is chatting in the village (which
she probably did every day of her life) he drives up wearing the
duplicate boots enters the kitchen goes through into the living-room fells the old man with a blow and then cuts his throat then he
returns to the kitchen removes the boots puts on another pair and carrying the first pair goes out to his trap and drives off again ""
ingles looked steadily at poirot ""there's a catch in it still why did nobody see him ""
""ah that is where the cleverness of number four i am convinced comes
in everybody saw him--and yet nobody saw him you see he drove up in
a butcher's cart ""
i uttered an exclamation ""the leg of mutton ""
""exactly hastings the leg of mutton everybody swore that no one had
been to granite bungalow that morning but nevertheless i found in
the larder a leg of mutton still frozen it was monday so the meat
must have been delivered that morning; for if on saturday in this hot
weather it would not have remained frozen over sunday so some one
_had_ been to the bungalow and a man on whom a trace of blood
here and there would attract no attention ""
""damned ingenious "" cried ingles approvingly ""yes he is clever number four ""
""as clever as hercule poirot "" i murmured my friend threw me a glance of dignified reproach ""there are some jests that you should not permit yourself hastings ""
he said sententiously ""have i not saved an innocent man from being
sent to the gallows that is enough for one day """
Chapter 5,"5 disappearance of a scientist
personally i don't think that even when a jury had acquitted robert
grant alias biggs of the murder of jonathan whalley inspector
meadows was entirely convinced of his innocence the case which he
had built up against grant--the man's record the jade which he had
stolen the boots which fitted the footprints so exactly--was to his
matter-of-fact mind too complete to be easily upset; but poirot compelled much against his inclination to give evidence convinced
the jury two witnesses were produced who had seen a butcher's cart
drive up to the bungalow on that monday morning and the local butcher
testified that his cart only called there on wednesdays and fridays a woman was actually found who when questioned remembered seeing the
butcher's man leaving the bungalow but she could furnish no useful
description of him the only impression he seemed to have left on her
mind was that he was clean-shaven of medium height and looked exactly
like a butcher's man at this description poirot shrugged his shoulders
philosophically ""it is as i tell you hastings "" he said to me after the trial ""he is
an artist this one he disguises himself not with the false beard and
the blue spectacles he alters his features yes; but that is the least
part for the time being he _is_ the man he would be he lives in
his part ""
certainly i was compelled to admit that the man who had visited us from
hanwell had fitted in exactly with my idea of what an asylum attendant
should look like i should never for a moment have dreamt of doubting
that he was genuine it was all a little discouraging and our experience on dartmoor did
not seem to have helped us at all i said as much to poirot but he
would not admit that we had gained nothing ""we progress "" he said; ""we progress at every contact with this man
we learn a little of his mind and his methods of us and our plans he
knows nothing ""
""and there poirot "" i protested ""he and i seem to be in the same
boat you don't seem to me to have any plans you seem to sit and wait
for him to do something ""
poirot smiled ""_mon ami_ you do not change always the same hastings who would
be up and at their throats perhaps "" he added as a knock sounded on
the door ""you have here your chance; it may be our friend who enters ""
and he laughed at my disappointment when inspector japp and another man
entered the room ""good-evening moosior "" said the inspector ""allow me to introduce
captain kent of the united states secret service ""
captain kent was a tall lean american with a singularly impassive
face which looked as though it had been carved out of wood ""pleased to meet you gentlemen "" he murmured as he shook hands
jerkily poirot threw an extra log on the fire and brought forward more
easy-chairs i brought out glasses and the whisky and soda the captain
took a deep draught and expressed appreciation ""legislation in your country is still sound "" he observed ""and now to business "" said japp ""moosior poirot here made a certain
request to me he was interested in some concern that went by the name
of the big four and he asked me to let him know at any time if i came
across a mention of it in my official line of business i didn't take
much stock in the matter but i remembered what he said and when the
captain here came over with rather a curious story i said at once 'we'll go round to moosior poirot's '""
poirot looked across at captain kent and the american took up the tale ""you may remember reading m poirot that a number of torpedo
boats and destroyers were sunk by being dashed upon the rocks off
the american coast it was just after the japanese earthquake and
the explanation given was that the disaster was the result of a
tidal wave now a short time ago a round-up was made of certain
crooks and gunmen and with them were captured some papers which
put an entirely new face upon the matter they appeared to refer
to some organisation called the 'big four ' and gave an incomplete
description of some powerful wireless installation--a concentration
of wireless energy far beyond anything so far attempted and capable
of focusing a beam of great intensity upon some given spot the
claims made for this invention seemed manifestly absurd but i turned
them in to headquarters for what they were worth and one of our
highbrow professors got busy on them now it appears that one of your
british scientists read a paper upon the subject before the british
association his colleagues didn't think great shakes of it by all
accounts thought it farfetched and fanciful but your scientist stuck
to his guns and declared that he himself was on the eve of success in
his experiments ""
""_eh bien _"" demanded poirot with interest ""it was suggested that i should come over here and get an interview
with this gentleman quite a young fellow he is halliday by name he is the leading authority on the subject and i was to get from him
whether the thing suggested was anyway possible ""
""and was it "" i asked eagerly ""that's just what i don't know i haven't seen mr halliday--and i'm
not likely to by all accounts ""
""the truth of the matter is "" said japp shortly ""halliday's
disappeared ""
""when ""
""two months ago ""
""was his disappearance reported ""
""of course it was his wife came to us in a great state we did what we
could but i knew all along it would be no good ""
""why not ""
""never is--when a man disappears that way "" japp winked ""what way ""
""paris ""
""so halliday disappeared in paris ""
""yes went over there on scientific work--so he said of course he'd
have to say something like that but you know what it means when a man
disappears over there either it's apache work and that's the end
of it--or else it's voluntary disappearance--and that's a great deal
the commoner of the two i can tell you gay paree and all that you
know sick of home life halliday and his wife had had a tiff before he
started which all helps to make it a pretty clear case ""
""i wonder "" said poirot thoughtfully the american was looking at him curiously ""say mister "" he drawled ""what's this big four idea ""
""the big four "" said poirot ""is an international organisation which
has at its head a chinaman he is known as number one number two is an
american number three is a frenchwoman number four the 'destroyer '
is an englishman ""
""a frenchwoman eh "" the american whistled ""and halliday disappeared
in france maybe there's something in this what's her name ""
""i don't know i know nothing about her ""
""but it's a mighty big proposition eh "" suggested the other poirot nodded as he arranged the glasses in a neat row on the tray his love of order was as great as ever ""what was the idea in sinking those boats are the big four a german
stunt ""
""the big four are for themselves--and for themselves only m le
capitaine their aim is world domination ""
the american burst out laughing but broke off at the sight of poirot's
serious face ""you laugh monsieur "" said poirot shaking a finger at him ""you
reflect not--you use not the little gray cells of the brain who are
these men who send a portion of your navy to destruction simply as a
trial of their power for that was all it was monsieur a test of this
new force of magnetical attraction which they hold ""
""go on with you moosior "" said japp good-humouredly ""i've read of
super criminals many a time but i've never come across them well you've heard captain kent's story anything further i can do for you ""
""yes my good friend you can give me the address of mrs halliday--and
also a few words of introduction to her if you will be so kind ""
thus it was that the following day saw us bound for chetwynd lodge near the village of chobham in surrey mrs halliday received us at once a tall fair woman nervous and
eager in manner with her was her little girl a beautiful child of
five poirot explained the purpose of our visit ""oh monsieur poirot i am so glad so thankful i have heard of you of course you will not be like these scotland yard people who will
not listen or try to understand and the french police are just as
bad--worse i think they are all convinced that my husband has gone
off with some other woman but he wasn't like that all he thought of
in life was his work half our quarrels came from that he cared for it
more than he did for me ""
""englishmen they are like that "" said poirot soothingly ""and if it is
not work it is the games the sport all those things they take _au
grand sÃ©rieux now madame recount to me exactly in detail and
as methodically as you can the exact circumstances of your husband's
disappearance ""
""my husband went to paris on thursday the 20th of july he was to meet
and visit various people there connected with his work amongst them
madame olivier ""
poirot nodded at the mention of the famous french woman chemist who
had eclipsed even madame curie in the brilliance of her achievements she had been decorated by the french government and was one of the
most prominent personalities of the day ""he arrived there in the evening and went at once to the hotel
castiglione in the rue de castiglione on the following morning he had
an appointment with professor bourgoneau which he kept his manner was
normal and pleasant the two men had a most interesting conversation and it was arranged that he should witness some experiments in the
professor's laboratory on the following day he lunched alone at the
cafÃ© royal went for a walk in the bois and then visited madame
olivier at her house at passy there also his manner was perfectly
normal he left about six where he dined is not known probably alone
at some restaurant he returned to the hotel about eleven o'clock and
went straight up to his room after inquiring if any letters had come
for him on the following morning he walked out of the hotel and has
not been seen again ""
""at what time did he leave the hotel at the hour when he would
normally leave it to keep his appointment at professor bourgoneau's
laboratory ""
""we do not know he was not remarked leaving the hotel but no
_petit dÃ©jeuner_ was served to him which seems to indicate that
he went out early ""
""or he might in fact have gone out again after he came in the night
before ""
""i do not think so his bed had been slept in and the night porter
would have remembered any one going out at that hour ""
""a very just observation madame we may take it then that he left
early on the following morning--and that is reassuring from one point
of view he is not likely to have fallen a victim to any apache assault
at that hour his baggage now was it all left behind ""
mrs halliday seemed rather reluctant to answer but at last she
said:---
""no--he must have taken one small suit-case with him ""
""h'm "" said poirot thoughtfully ""i wonder where he was that evening if we knew that we should know a great deal whom did he meet --there
lies the mystery madame myself i do not of necessity accept the view
of the police; with them is it always '_cherchez la femme_ ' yet
it is clear that something occurred that night to alter your husband's
plans you say he asked for letters on returning to the hotel did he
receive any ""
""one only and that must have been the one i wrote him on the day he
left england ""
poirot remained sunk in thought for a full minute then he rose briskly
to his feet ""well madame the solution of the mystery lies in paris and to find
it i myself journey to paris on the instant ""
""it is all a long time ago monsieur ""
""yes yes nevertheless it is there that we must seek ""
he turned to leave the room but paused with his hand on the door ""tell me madame do you ever remember your husband mentioning the
phrase 'the big four' ""
""the big four "" she repeated thoughtfully ""no i can't say i do """
Chapter 6,"6 the woman on the stairs
that was all that could be elicited from mrs halliday we hurried
back to london and the following day saw us _en route_ for the
continent with rather a rueful smile poirot observed:---
""this big four they make me to bestir myself _mon ami_ i run
up and down all over the ground like our old friend 'the human
foxhound '""
""perhaps you'll meet him in paris "" i said knowing that he referred
to a certain giraud one of the most trusted detectives of the suretÃ© whom he had met on a previous occasion poirot made a grimace ""i devoutly hope not he loved me not that one ""
""won't it be a very difficult task "" i asked ""to find out what an
unknown englishman did on an evening two months ago ""
""very difficult _mon ami_ but as you know well difficulties
rejoice the heart of hercule poirot ""
""you think the big four kidnapped him ""
poirot nodded our inquiries necessarily went over old ground and we learnt little
to add to what mrs halliday had already told us poirot had a lengthy
interview with professor bourgoneau during which he sought to elicit
whether halliday had mentioned any plan of his own for the evening but
we drew a complete blank our next source of information was the famous madame olivier i was
quite excited as we mounted the steps of her villa at passy it has
always seemed to me extraordinary that a woman should go so far in the
scientific world i should have thought a purely masculine brain was
needed for such work the door was opened by a young lad of seventeen or thereabouts who
reminded me vaguely of an acolyte so ritualistic was his manner poirot had taken the trouble to arrange our interview beforehand as
he knew madame olivier never received any one without an appointment being immersed in research work most of the day we were shown into a small _salon_ and presently the mistress
of the house came to us there madame olivier was a very tall woman her tallness accentuated by the long white overall she wore and a
coif like a nun's that shrouded her head she had a long pale face and wonderful dark eyes that burnt with a light almost fanatical she
looked more like a priestess of old than a modern frenchwoman one
cheek was disfigured by a scar and i remembered that her husband and
co-worker had been killed in an explosion in the laboratory three years
before and that she herself had been terribly burned ever since
then she had shut herself away from the world and plunged with fiery
energy into the work of scientific research she received us with cold
politeness ""i have been interviewed by the police many times messieurs i think
it hardly likely that i can help you since i have not been able to
help them ""
""madame it is possible that i shall not ask you quite the same
questions to begin with of what did you talk together you and m halliday ""
she looked a trifle surprised ""but of his work his work--and also mine ""
""did he mention to you the theories he had embodied recently in his
paper read before the british association ""
""certainly he did it was chiefly of those we spoke ""
""his ideas were somewhat fantastic were they not "" asked poirot
carelessly ""some people have thought so i do not agree ""
""you considered them practicable ""
""perfectly practicable my own line of research has been somewhat
similar though not undertaken with the same end in view i have been
investigating the _gamma_ rays emitted by the substance usually
known as radium c a product of radium emanation and in doing so i
have come across some very interesting magnetical phenomena indeed i
have a theory as to the actual nature of the force we call magnetism but it is not yet time for my discoveries to be given to the world mr halliday's experiments and views were exceedingly interesting to me ""
poirot nodded then he asked a question which surprised me ""madame where did you converse on these topics in here ""
""no monsieur in the laboratory ""
""may i see it ""
""certainly ""
she led the way to the door from which she had entered it opened on a
small passage we passed through two doors and found ourselves in the
big laboratory with its array of beakers and crucibles and a hundred
appliances of which i did not even know the names there were two
occupants both busy with some experiment madame olivier introduced
them ""mademoiselle claude one of my assistants "" a tall serious-faced
young girl bowed to us ""monsieur henri an old and trusted friend ""
the young man short and dark bowed jerkily poirot looked round him there were two other doors besides the one by
which we had entered one madame explained led into the garden the
other into a smaller chamber also devoted to research poirot took all
this in then declared himself ready to return to the salon ""madame were you alone with m halliday during your interview ""
""yes monsieur my two assistants were in the smaller room next door ""
""could your conversation be overheard--by them or any one else ""
madame reflected then shook her head ""i do not think so i am almost sure it could not the doors were all
shut ""
""could any one have been concealed in the room ""
""there is the big cupboard in the corner--but the idea is absurd ""
""_pas tout Ã  fait_ madame one thing more: did m halliday make
any mention of his plans for the evening ""
""he said nothing whatever monsieur ""
""i thank you madame and i apologise for disturbing you pray do not
trouble--we can find our way out ""
we stepped out into the hall a lady was just entering the front door
as we did so she ran quickly up the stairs and i was left with an
impression of the heavy mourning that denotes a french widow ""a most unusual type of woman that "" remarked poirot as we walked
away ""madame olivier yes she--""
""_mais non_ not madame olivier _cela va sans dire _ there
are not many geniuses of her stamp in the world no i referred to the
other lady--the lady on the stairs ""
""i didn't see her face "" i said staring ""and i hardly see how you
could have done she never looked at us ""
""that is why i said she was an unusual type "" said poirot placidly ""a woman who enters her home--for i presume that it is her home
since she enters with a key--and runs straight upstairs without even
looking at two strange visitors in the hall to see who they are is a
_very_ unusual type of woman--quite unnatural in fact _mille
tonnerres _ what is that ""
he dragged me back--just in time a tree had crashed down on to the
side walk just missing us poirot stared at it pale and upset ""it was a near thing that but clumsy all the same--for i had no
suspicion--at least hardly any suspicion yes but for my quick
eyes the eyes of a cat hercule poirot might now be crushed out of
existence--a terrible calamity for the world and you too _mon
ami_--though that would not be such a national catastrophe ""
""thank you "" i said coldly ""and what are we going to do now ""
""do "" cried poirot ""we are going to think yes here and now we are
going to exercise our little gray cells this m halliday now was he
really in paris yes for professor bourgoneau who knows him saw and
spoke to him ""
""what on earth are you driving at "" i cried ""that was friday morning he was last seen at eleven friday night--but
_was_ he seen then ""
""the porter--""
""a night porter--who had not previously seen halliday a man comes in sufficiently like halliday---we may trust number four for that--asks
for letters goes upstairs packs a small suit-case and slips out the
next morning nobody saw halliday all that evening--no because he
was already in the hands of his enemies was it halliday whom madame
olivier received yes for though she did not know him by sight an
imposter could hardly deceive her on her own special subject he came
here he had his interview he left what happened next ""
seizing me by the arm poirot was fairly dragging me back to the villa ""now _mon ami_ imagine that it is the day after the
disappearance and that we are tracking footprints you love
footprints do you not see--here they go a man's mr halliday's he turns to the right as we did he walks briskly--ah other footsteps
following behind--very quickly--small footsteps a woman's see she catches him up--a slim young woman in a widow's veil 'pardon monsieur madame olivier desires that i recall you ' he stops he
turns now where would the young woman take him she does not wish to
be seen walking with him is it coincidence that she catches up with
him just where a narrow alleyway opens dividing two gardens she leads
him down it 'it is shorter this way monsieur ' on the right is the
garden of madame olivier's villa on the left the garden of another
villa--and from that garden mark you the tree fell--so nearly on us garden doors from both open on the alley the ambush is there men pour
out overpower him and carry him into the strange villa ""
""good gracious poirot "" i cried ""are you pretending to see all this ""
""i see it with the eyes of the mind _mon ami_ so and only so could it have happened come let us go back to the house ""
""you want to see madame olivier again ""
poirot gave a curious smile ""no hastings i want to see the face of the lady on the stairs ""
""who do you think she is a relation of madame olivier's ""
""more probably a secretary--and a secretary engaged not very long ago ""
the same gentle acolyte opened the door to us ""can you tell me "" said poirot ""the name of the lady the widow lady who came in just now ""
""madame veroneau madame's secretary ""
""that is the lady would you be so kind as to ask her to speak to us
for a moment ""
the youth disappeared he soon reappeared ""i am sorry madame veroneau must have gone out again ""
""i think not "" said poirot quietly ""will you give her my name m hercule poirot and say that it is important i should see her at once as i am just going to the prefecture ""
again our messenger departed this time the lady descended she walked
into the salon we followed her she turned and raised her veil to my
astonishment i recognised our old antagonist the countess rossakoff a
russian countess who had engineered a particularly smart jewel robbery
in london ""as soon as i caught sight of you in the hall i feared the worst "" she
observed plaintively ""my dear countess rossakoff--""
she shook her head ""inez veroneau now "" she murmured ""a spaniard married to a frenchman what do you want of me m poirot you are a terrible man you hunted
me from london now i suppose you will tell our wonderful madame
olivier about me and hunt me from paris we poor russians we must
live you know ""
""it is more serious than that madame "" said poirot watching her ""i
propose to enter the villa next door and release m halliday if he
is still alive i know everything you see ""
i saw her sudden pallor she bit her lip then she spoke with her usual
decision ""he is still alive--but he is not at the villa come monsieur i will
make a bargain with you freedom for me--and m halliday alive and
well for you ""
""i accept "" said poirot ""i was about to propose the same bargain
myself by the way are the big four your employers madame ""
again i saw that deathly pallor creep over her face but she left his
question unanswered instead ""you permit me to telephone "" she asked and crossing to
the instrument she rang up a number ""the number of the villa "" she
explained ""where our friend is now imprisoned you may give it to the
police--the nest will be empty when they arrive ah i am through is
that you andrÃ© it is i inez the little belgian knows all send
halliday to the hotel and clear out ""
she replaced the receiver and came towards us smiling ""you will accompany us to the hotel madame ""
""naturally i expected that ""
i got a taxi and we drove off together i could see by poirot's face
that he was perplexed the thing was almost too easy we arrived at the
hotel the porter came up to us ""a gentleman has arrived he is in your rooms he seems very ill a
nurse came with him but she has left ""
""that is all right "" said poirot ""he is a friend of mine ""
we went upstairs together sitting in a chair by the window was a
haggard young fellow who looked in the last stages of exhaustion poirot went over to him ""are you john halliday "" the man nodded ""show me your left arm john
halliday has a mole just below the left elbow ""
the man stretched out his arm the mole was there poirot bowed to the
countess she turned and left the room a glass of brandy revived halliday somewhat ""my god "" he muttered ""i have been through hell--hell those fiends
are devils incarnate my wife where is she what does she think they
told me that she would believe--would believe--""
""she does not "" said poirot firmly ""her faith in you has never
wavered she is waiting for you--she and the child ""
""thank god for that i can hardly believe that i am free once more ""
""now that you are a little recovered monsieur i should like to hear
the whole story from the beginning ""
halliday looked at him with an indescribable expression ""i remember--nothing "" he said ""what ""
""have you ever heard of the big four ""
""something of them "" said poirot dryly ""you do not know what i know they have unlimited power if i remain
silent i shall be safe--if i say one word--not only i but my nearest
and dearest will suffer unspeakable things it is no good arguing with
me _i know_ i remember--nothing ""
and getting up he walked from the room * * * * *
poirot's face wore a baffled expression ""so it is like that is it "" he muttered ""the big four win again what
is that you are holding in your hand hastings ""
i handed it to him ""the countess scribbled it before she left "" i explained he read it ""au revoir --i v ""
""signed with her initials--i v just a coincidence perhaps that they
also stand for _four_ i wonder hastings i wonder """
Chapter 7,"7 the radium thieves
on the night of his release halliday slept in the room next to ours at
the hotel and all night long i heard him moaning and protesting in his
sleep undoubtedly his experience in the villa had broken his nerve and in the morning we failed completely to extract any information from
him he would only repeat his statement about the unlimited power at
the disposal of the big four and his assurance of the vengeance which
would follow if he talked after lunch he departed to rejoin his wife in england but poirot and i
remained behind in paris i was all for energetic proceedings of some
kind or other and poirot's quiescence annoyed me ""for heaven's sake poirot "" i urged ""let us be up and at them ""
""admirable _mon ami_ admirable up where and at whom be
precise i beg of you ""
""at the big four of course ""
""_cela va sans dire _ but how would you set about it ""
""the police "" i hazarded doubtfully poirot smiled ""they would accuse us of romancing we have nothing to go upon--nothing
whatever we must wait ""
""wait for what ""
""wait for them to make a move see now in england you all comprehend
and adore _la boxe_ if one man does not make a move the other
must and by permitting the adversary to make the attack one learns
something about him that is our part--to let the other side make the
attack ""
""you think they will "" i said doubtfully ""i have no doubt whatever of it to begin with see they try to get me
out of england that fails then in the dartmoor affair we step in
and save their victim from the gallows and yesterday once again we
interfere with their plans assuredly they will not leave the matter
there ""
as i reflected on this there was a knock on the door without waiting
for a reply a man stepped into the room and closed the door behind
him he was a tall thin man with a slightly hooked nose and a sallow
complexion he wore an overcoat buttoned up to his chin and a soft hat
well pulled down over his eyes ""excuse me gentlemen for my somewhat unceremonious entry "" he said in
a soft voice ""but my business is of a rather unorthodox nature ""
smiling he advanced to the table and sat down by it i was about to
spring up but poirot restrained me with a gesture ""as you say monsieur your entry is somewhat unceremonious will you
kindly state your business ""
""my dear m poirot it is very simple you have been annoying my
friends ""
""in what way ""
""come come monsieur poirot you do not seriously ask me that you
know as well as i do ""
""it depends monsieur upon who these friends of yours are ""
without a word the man drew from his pocket a cigarette case and opening it took out four cigarettes and tossed them on the table then
he picked them up and returned them to his case which he replaced in
his pocket ""aha "" said poirot ""so it is like that is it and what do your
friends suggest ""
""they suggest monsieur that you should employ your talents--your very
considerable talents--in the detection of legitimate crime--return
to your former avocations and solve the problems of london society
ladies ""
""a peaceful programme "" said poirot ""and supposing i do not agree ""
the man made an eloquent gesture ""we should regret it of course exceedingly "" he said ""so would all
the friends and admirers of the great m hercule poirot but regrets however poignant do not bring a man to life again ""
""put very delicately "" said poirot nodding his head ""and supposing
i--accept ""
""in that case i am empowered to offer you--compensation ""
he drew out a pocket-book and threw ten notes on the table they were
for ten thousand francs each ""that is merely as a guarantee of our good faith "" he said ""ten times
that amount will be paid you ""
""good god "" i cried springing up ""you dare to think-- ""
""sit down hastings "" said poirot autocratically ""subdue your so
beautiful and honest nature and sit down to you monsieur i will say
this what is to prevent me ringing up the police and giving you into
their custody whilst my friend here prevents you from escaping ""
""by all means do so if you think it advisable "" said our visitor calmly ""oh look here poirot "" i cried ""i can't stand this ring up the
police and have done with it ""
rising swiftly i strode to the door and stood with my back against it ""it seems the obvious course "" murmured poirot as though debating with
himself ""but you distrust the obvious eh "" said our visitor smiling ""go on poirot "" i urged ""it will be your responsibility _mon ami_ ""
as he lifted the receiver the man made a sudden cat-like jump at
me i was ready for him in another minute we were locked together staggering round the room suddenly i felt him slip and falter i
pressed my advantage he went down before me and then in the very
flush of victory an extraordinary thing happened i felt myself flying
forwards head first i crashed into the wall in a complicated heap i was up in a minute but the door was already closing behind my late
adversary i rushed to it and shook it it was locked on the outside i
seized the telephone from poirot ""is that the bureau stop a man who is coming out a tall man with a
buttoned-up overcoat and a soft hat he is wanted by the police ""
very few minutes elapsed before we heard a noise in the corridor
outside the key was turned and the door flung open the manager
himself stood in the doorway ""the man--you have got him "" i cried ""no monsieur no one has descended ""
""you must have passed him ""
""we have passed no one monsieur it is incredible that he can have
escaped ""
""you have passed some one i think "" said poirot in his gentle voice ""one of the hotel staff perhaps ""
""only a waiter carrying a tray monsieur ""
""ah "" said poirot in a tone that spoke infinities ""so that was why he wore his overcoat buttoned up to his chin "" mused
poirot when we had finally got rid of the excited hotel officials ""i'm awfully sorry poirot "" i murmured rather crestfallen ""i thought
i'd downed him all right ""
""yes that was a japanese trick i fancy do not distress yourself _mon ami_ all went according to plan--his plan that is what i
wanted ""
""what's this "" i cried pouncing on a brown object that lay on the
floor it was a slim pocket-book of brown leather and had evidently fallen
from our visitor's pocket during his struggle with me it contained
two receipted bills in the name of m felix laon and a folded-up
piece of paper which made my heart beat faster it was a half sheet of
note-paper on which a few words were scrawled in pencil but they were
words of supreme importance ""the next meeting of the council will be on friday at 34 rue des
echelles at 11 a m ""
it was signed with a big figure 4 and to-day was friday and the clock on the mantelpiece showed the hour
to be 10:30 ""my god what a chance "" i cried ""fate is playing into our hands we
must start at once--though what stupendous luck ""
""so that was why he came "" murmured poirot ""i see it all now ""
""see what come on poirot don't stay daydreaming there ""
poirot looked at me and slowly shook his head smiling as he did so ""'will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly ' that
is your little english nursery rhyme is it not no no--they are
subtle--but not so subtle as hercule poirot ""
""what on earth are you driving at poirot ""
""my friend i have been asking myself the reason of this morning's
visit did our visitor really hope to succeed in bribing me or alternatively in frightening me into abandoning my task it seemed
hardly credible why then did he come and now i see the whole
plan--very neat--very pretty--the ostensible reason to bribe or
frighten me--the necessary struggle which he took no pains to
avoid and which should make the dropped pocket-book natural and
reasonable--and finally--the pitfall rue des echelles 11 a m i
think not _mon ami_ one does not catch hercule poirot as easily
as that ""
""good heavens "" i gasped poirot was frowning to himself ""there is still one thing i do not understand ""
""what is that ""
""the time hastings--the time if they wanted to decoy me away surely
night time would be better why this early hour is it possible that
something is about to happen this morning something which they are
anxious hercule poirot should not know about ""
he shook his head ""we shall see here i sit _mon ami_ we do not stir out this
morning we await events here ""
it was at half-past eleven exactly that the summons came a _petit
bleu_ poirot tore it open then handed it to me it was from madame
olivier the world-famous scientist whom we had visited yesterday in
connection with the halliday case it asked us to come out to passy at
once we obeyed the summons without an instant's delay madame olivier
received us in the same small salon i was struck anew with the
wonderful power of this woman with her long nun's face and burning
eyes--this brilliant successor of becquerel and the curies she came to
the point at once ""messieurs you interviewed me yesterday about the disappearance of m halliday i now learn that you returned to the house a second time and
asked to see my secretary inez veroneau she left the house with you and has not returned here since ""
""is that all madame ""
""no monsieur it is not last night the laboratory was broken into and several valuable papers and memoranda were stolen the thieves had
a try for something more precious still but luckily they failed to
open the big safe ""
""madame these are the facts of the case your late secretary madame
veroneau was really the countess rossakoff an expert thief and it
was she who was responsible for the disappearance of m halliday how
long had she been with you ""
""five months monsieur what you say amazes me ""
""it is true nevertheless these papers were they easy to find or do
you think an inside knowledge was shown ""
""it is rather curious that the thieves knew exactly where to look you
think inez--""
""yes i have no doubt that it was upon her information that they acted but what is this precious thing that the thieves failed to find jewels ""
madame olivier shook her head with a faint smile ""something much more precious than that monsieur "" she looked round
her then bent forward lowering her voice ""radium monsieur ""
""radium ""
""yes monsieur i am now at the crux of my experiments i possess
a small portion of radium myself--more has been lent to me for the
process i am at work upon small though the actual quantity is it
comprises a large amount of the world's stock and represents a value of
millions of francs ""
""and where is it ""
""in its leaden case in the big safe--the safe purposely appears to
be of an old and worn-out pattern but it is really a triumph of the
safe-maker's art that is probably why the thieves were unable to open
it ""
""how long are you keeping this radium in your possession ""
""only for two days more monsieur then my experiments will be
concluded ""
poirot's eyes brightened ""and inez veroneau is aware of the fact good--then our friends will
come back not a word of me to any one madame but rest assured i
will save your radium for you you have a key of the door leading from
the laboratory to the garden ""
""yes monsieur here it is i have a duplicate for myself and here is
the key of the garden door leading out into the alleyway between this
villa and the next one ""
""i thank you madame to-night go to bed as usual have no fears and leave all to me but not a word to any one--not to your
two assistants--mademoiselle claude and monsieur henri is it
not --particularly not a word to them ""
poirot left the villa rubbing his hands in great satisfaction ""what are we going to do now "" i asked ""now hastings we are about to leave paris--for england ""
""what ""
""we will pack our effects have lunch and drive to the gare du nord ""
""but the radium ""
""i said we were going to leave for england--i did not say we were going
to arrive there reflect a moment hastings it is quite certain that
we are being watched and followed our enemies must believe that we are
going back to england and they certainly will not believe that unless
they see us get on board the train and start ""
""do you mean we are to slip off again at the last minute ""
""no hastings our enemies will be satisfied with nothing less than a
_bona fide_ departure ""
""but the train doesn't stop until calais ""
""it will stop if it is paid to do so ""
""oh come now poirot--surely you can't pay an express to stop--they'd
refuse ""
""my dear friend have you never remarked the little handle--the
_signal d'arrÃªt_--penalty for improper use 100 francs i think ""
""oh you are going to pull that ""
""or rather a friend of mine pierre combeau will do so then while he
is arguing with the guard and making a big scene and all the train is
agog with interest you and i will fade quietly away ""
we duly carried out poirot's plan pierre combeau an old crony of
poirot's and who evidently knew my little friend's methods pretty
well fell in with the arrangements the communication cord was pulled
just as we got to the outskirts of paris combeau ""made a scene"" in
the most approved french fashion and poirot and i were able to leave
the train without any one being interested in our departure our
first proceeding was to make a considerable change in our appearance poirot had brought the materials for this with him in a small case two loafers in dirty blue blouses were the result we had dinner in an
obscure hostelry and started back to paris afterwards it was close on eleven o'clock when we found ourselves once more in
the neighbourhood of madame olivier's villa we looked up and down the
road before slipping into the alleyway the whole place appeared to be
perfectly deserted one thing we could be quite certain of no one was
following us ""i do not expect them to be here yet "" whispered poirot to me ""possibly they may not come until to-morrow night but they know
perfectly well that there are only two nights on which the radium will
be there ""
very cautiously we turned the key in the garden door it opened
noiselessly and we stepped into the garden and then with complete unexpectedness the blow fell in a minute we
were surrounded gagged and bound at least ten men must have been
waiting for us resistance was useless like two helpless bundles we
were lifted up and carried along to my intense astonishment they
took us _towards_ the house and not away from it with a key they
opened the door into the laboratory and carried us into it one of the
men stooped down before the big safe the door of it swung open i felt
an unpleasant sensation down my spine were they going to bundle us
into it and leave us there to asphyxiate slowly however to my amazement i saw that from the inside of the safe
steps led down beneath the floor we were thrust down this narrow
way and eventually came out into a big subterranean chamber a woman
stood there tall and imposing with a black velvet mask covering her
face she was clearly in command of the situation by her gestures of
authority the men slung us down on the floor and left us--alone with
the mysterious creature in the mask i had no doubt who she was this
was the unknown frenchwoman--number three of the big four she knelt down beside us and removed the gags but left us bound then
rising and facing us with a sudden swift gesture she removed her mask it was madame olivier ""m poirot "" she said in a low mocking tone ""the great the
wonderful the unique m poirot i sent a warning to you yesterday
morning you chose to disregard it--you thought you could pit your wits
against us and now you are here ""
there was a cold malignity about her that froze me to the marrow it was so at variance with the burning fire of her eyes she was
mad--mad--with the madness of genius poirot said nothing his jaw had dropped and he was staring at her ""well "" she said softly ""this is the end we cannot permit our plans
to be interfered with have you any last request to make ""
never before or since have i felt so near death poirot was
magnificent he neither flinched nor paled just stared at her with
unabated interest ""your psychology interests me enormously madame "" he said quietly ""it
is a pity that i have so short a time to devote to studying it yes i
have a request to make a condemned man is always allowed a last smoke i believe i have my cigarette case on me if you would permit--"" he
looked down at his bonds ""ah yes "" she laughed ""you would like me to untie your hands would
you not you are clever m hercule poirot i know that i shall not
untie your hands--but i will find you a cigarette ""
she knelt down by him extracted his cigarette case took out a
cigarette and placed it between his lips ""and now a match "" she said rising ""it is not necessary madame "" something in his voice startled me she too was arrested ""do not move i pray of you madame you will regret it if you do are
you acquainted at all with the properties of cuare the south american
indians use it as an arrow poison a scratch with it means death some tribes use a little blow-pipe--i too have a little blow-pipe
constructed so as to look exactly like a cigarette i have only to
blow ah you start do not move madame the mechanism of this
cigarette is most ingenious one blows--and a tiny dart resembling a
fishbone flies through the air--to find its mark you do not wish to
die madame therefore i beg of you release my friend hastings from
his bonds i cannot use my hands but i can turn my head--so--you are
still covered madame make no mistake i beg of you ""
slowly with shaking hands and rage and hate convulsing her face she bent down and did his bidding i was free poirot's voice gave me
instructions ""your bonds will now do for the lady hastings that is right is she
securely fastened then release me i pray of you it is a fortunate
circumstance she sent away her henchmen with a little luck we may hope
to find the way out unobstructed ""
in another minute poirot stood by my side he bowed to the lady ""hercule poirot is not killed so easily madame i wish you
good-night ""
the gag prevented her from replying but the murderous gleam in her
eyes frightened me i hoped devoutly that we should never fall into her
power again three minutes later we were outside the villa and hurriedly traversing
the garden the road outside was deserted and we were soon clear of
the neighbourhood then poirot broke out ""i deserve all that that woman said to me i am a triple imbecile a miserable animal thirty-six times an idiot i was proud of
myself for not falling into their trap and it was not even meant
as a trap--except exactly in the way in which i fell into it they
knew i would see through it--they counted on my seeing through
it this explains all--the ease with which they surrendered
halliday--everything madame olivier was the ruling spirit---vera
rossakoff only her lieutenant madame needed halliday's ideas--she
herself had the necessary genius to supply the gaps that perplexed
him yes hastings we know now who number three is--the woman who is
probably the greatest scientist in the world think of it the brain
of the east the science of the west--and two others whose identities
we do not yet know but we must find out to-morrow we will return to
london and set about it ""
""you are not going to denounce madame olivier to the police ""
""i should not be believed that woman is one of the idols of france and we can prove nothing we are lucky if she does not denounce
_us_ ""
""what ""
""think of it we are found at night upon the premises with keys in our
possession which she will swear she never gave us she surprises us at
the safe and we gag and bind her and make away have no illusions hastings the boot is not upon the right leg--is that how you say it """
Chapter 8,"8 in the house of the enemy
after our adventure in the villa at passy we returned post haste to
london several letters were awaiting poirot he read one of them with
a curious smile and then handed it to me ""read this _mon ami_ ""
i turned first to the signature ""abe ryland "" and recalled poirot's
words: ""the richest man in the world "" mr ryland's letter was curt
and incisive he expressed himself as profoundly dissatisfied with
the reasons poirot had given for withdrawing from the south american
proposition at the last moment ""this gives one furiously to think does it not "" said poirot ""i suppose it's only natural he should be a bit ratty ""
""no no you comprehend not remember the words of mayerling the man
who took refuge here--only to die by the hands of his enemies 'number
two is represented by an s with two lines through it--the sign for a
dollar also by two stripes and a star it may be conjectured therefore
that he is an american subject and that he represents the power of
wealth ' add to those words the fact that ryland offered me a huge sum
to tempt me out of england--and--and what about it hastings ""
""you mean "" i said staring ""that you suspect abe ryland the
multi-millionaire of being number two of the big four ""
""your bright intellect has grasped the idea hastings yes i do the tone in which you said multi-millionaire was eloquent--but let
me impress upon you one fact--this thing is being run by men at the
top--and mr ryland has the reputation of being no beauty in his
business dealings an able unscrupulous man a man who has all the
wealth that he needs and is out for unlimited power ""
there was undoubtedly something to be said for poirot's view i asked
him when he had made up his mind definitely upon the point ""that is just it i am not sure i cannot be sure _mon ami_ i would give anything to _know_ let me but place number two
definitely as abe ryland and we draw nearer to our goal ""
""he has just arrived in london i see by this "" i said tapping the
letter ""shall you call upon him and make your apologies in person ""
""i might do so ""
two days later poirot returned to our rooms in a state of boundless
excitement he grasped me by both hands in his most impulsive manner ""my friend an occasion stupendous unprecedented never to be
repeated has presented itself but there is danger grave danger i
should not even ask you to attempt it ""
if poirot was trying to frighten me he was going the wrong way to
work and so i told him becoming less incoherent he unfolded his plan it seemed that ryland was looking for an english secretary one with
a good social manner and presence it was poirot's suggestion that i
should apply for the post ""i would do it myself _mon ami_ "" he explained apologetically ""but see you it is almost impossible for me to disguise myself in
the needful manner i speak the english very well--except when i am
excited--but hardly so as to deceive the ear; and even though i were
to sacrifice my moustaches i doubt not but that i should still be
recognisable as hercule poirot ""
i doubted it also and declared myself ready and willing to take up the
part and penetrate into ryland's household ""ten to one he won't engage me anyway "" i remarked ""oh yes he will i will arrange for you such testimonials as shall
make him lick his lips the home secretary himself shall recommend
you ""
this seemed to be carrying things a bit far but poirot waved aside my
remonstrances ""oh yes he will do it i investigated for him a little matter which
might have caused a grave scandal all was solved with discretion and
delicacy and now as you would say he perches upon my hand like the
little bird and pecks the crumbs ""
our first step was to engage the services of an artist in ""make up "" he
was a little man with a quaint bird-like turn of the head not unlike
poirot's own he considered me some time in silence and then fell to
work when i looked at myself in the glass half an hour afterwards i was amazed special shoes caused me to stand at least two inches
taller and the coat i wore was arranged so as to give me a long lank weedy look my eyebrows had been cunningly altered giving a totally
different expression to my face i wore pads in my cheeks and the deep
tan of my face was a thing of the past my moustache had gone and a
gold tooth was prominent on one side of my mouth ""your name "" said poirot ""is arthur neville god guard you my
friend--for i fear that you go into perilous places ""
it was with a beating heart that i presented myself at the savoy at an
hour named by mr ryland and asked to see the great man after being kept waiting a minute or two i was shown upstairs to his
suite ryland was sitting at a table spread out in front of him was a letter
which i could see out of the tail of my eye was in the home secretary's
handwriting it was my first sight of the american millionaire and in
spite of myself i was impressed he was tall and lean with a jutting
out chin and slightly hooked nose his eyes glittered cold and gray
behind penthouse brows he had thick grizzled hair and a long black
cigar (without which i learned later he was never seen) protruded
rakishly from the corner of his mouth ""siddown "" he grunted i sat he tapped the letter in front of him ""according to this piece here you're the goods all right and i don't
need to look further say are you well up in the social matters ""
i said that i thought i could satisfy him in that respect ""i mean to say if i have a lot of dooks and earls and viscounts and
suchlike down to the country place i've gotten you'll be able to sort
them out all right and put them where they should be round the dining
table ""
""oh quite easily "" i replied smiling we exchanged a few more preliminaries and then i found myself engaged what mr ryland wanted was a secretary conversant with english society as he already had an american secretary and a stenographer with him two days later i went down to hatton chase the seat of the duke of
loamshire which the american millionaire had rented for a period of
six months my duties gave me no difficulty whatever at one period of my life i
had been private secretary to a busy member of parliament so i was
not called upon to assume a role unfamiliar to me mr ryland usually
entertained a large party over the week-end but the middle of the week
was comparatively quiet i saw very little of mr appleby the american
secretary but he seemed a pleasant normal young american very
efficient in his work of miss martin the stenographer i saw rather
more she was a pretty girl of about twenty-three or four with auburn
hair and brown eyes that could look mischievous enough upon occasion though they were usually cast demurely down i had an idea that she
both disliked and distrusted her employer though of course she was
careful never to hint at anything of the kind but the time came when i
was unexpectedly taken into her confidence i had of course carefully scrutinised all the members of the
household one or two of the servants had been newly engaged one of
the footmen i think and some of the housemaids the butler the
housekeeper and the chef were the duke's own staff who had consented
to remain on in the establishment the housemaids i dismissed as
unimportant; i scrutinised james the second footman very carefully;
but it was clear that he was an under-footman and an under-footman
only he had indeed been engaged by the butler a person of whom
i was far more suspicious was deaves ryland's valet whom he had
brought over from new york with him an englishman by birth with an
irreproachable manner i yet harboured vague suspicions about him i had been at hatton chase three weeks and not an incident of any kind
had arisen which i could lay my finger on in support of our theory there was no trace of the activities of the big four mr ryland was a
man of overpowering force and personality but i was coming to believe
that poirot had made a mistake when he associated him with that dread
organisation i even heard him mention poirot in a casual way at dinner
one night ""wonderful little man they say but he's a quitter how do i know i put him on a deal and he turned me down the last minute i'm not
taking any more of your monsieur hercule poirot ""
it was at moments such as these that i felt my cheek pads most
wearisome and then miss martin told me a rather curious story ryland had gone
to london for the day taking appleby with him miss martin and i were
strolling together in the garden after tea i liked the girl very
much she was so unaffected and so natural i could see that there was
something on her mind and at last out it came ""do you know major neville "" she said ""i am really thinking of
resigning my post here ""
i looked somewhat astonished and she went on hurriedly ""oh i know it's a wonderful job to have got in a way i suppose most
people would think me a fool to throw it up but i can't stand abuse major neville to be sworn at like a trooper is more than i can bear no gentleman would do such a thing ""
""has ryland been swearing at you ""
she nodded ""of course he's always rather irritable and short tempered that one
expects it's all in the day's work but to fly into such an absolute
fury--over nothing at all he really looked as though he could have
murdered me and as i say over nothing at all ""
""tell me about it "" i said keenly interested ""as you know i open all mr ryland's letters some i hand on to mr appleby others i deal with myself but i do all the preliminary
sorting now there are certain letters that come written on blue
paper and with a tiny 4 marked on the corner--i beg your pardon did
you speak ""
i had been unable to repress a stifled exclamation but i hurriedly
shook my head and begged her to continue ""well as i was saying these letters come and there are strict orders
that they are never to be opened but to be handed over to mr ryland
intact and of course i always do so but there was an unusually
heavy mail yesterday morning and i was opening the letters in a
terrific hurry by mistake i opened one of these letters as soon as i
saw what i had done i took it to mr ryland and explained to my utter
amazement he flew into the most awful rage as i tell you i was quite
frightened ""
""what was there in the letter i wonder to upset him so ""
""absolutely nothing--that's just the curious part of it i had read
it before i discovered my mistake it was quite short i can still
remember it word for word and there was nothing in it that could
possibly upset any one ""
""you can repeat it you say "" i encouraged her ""yes "" she paused a minute and then repeated slowly whilst i noted
down the words unobtrusively the following:--
 ""dear sir --the essential thing now i should say is to
 see the property if you insist on the quarry being included then
 seventeen thousand seems reasonable 11% commission too much 4% is
 ample ""yours truly ""arthur leversham ""
miss martin went on:--
""evidently about some property mr ryland was thinking of buying but
really i do feel that a man who can get into a rage over such a trifle
is well dangerous what do you think i ought to do major neville you've more experience of the world than i have ""
i soothed the girl down pointed out to her that mr ryland had
probably been suffering from the enemy of his race--dyspepsia in
the end i sent her away quite comforted but i was not so easily
satisfied myself when the girl had gone and i was alone i took out
my notebook and ran over the letter which i had jotted down what did
it mean--this apparently innocent-sounding missive did it concern some
business deal which ryland was undertaking and was he anxious that no
details about it should leak out until it was carried through that was
a possible explanation but i remembered the small figure 4 with which
the envelopes were marked and i felt that at last i was on the track
of the thing we were seeking i puzzled over the letter all that evening and most of the next
day--and then suddenly the solution came to me it was so simple too the figure 4 was the clue read every fourth word in the letter and an
entirely different message appeared ""essential should see you quarry
seventeen eleven four ""
the solution of the figures was easy seventeen stood for the
seventeenth of october--which was to-morrow eleven was the time and
four was the signature--either referring to the mysterious number four
himself--or else it was the ""trade-mark"" so to speak of the big four the quarry was also intelligible there was a big disused quarry on the
estate about half a mile from the house--a lonely spot ideal for a
secret meeting for a moment or two i was tempted to run the show myself it would be
such a feather in my cap for once to have the pleasure of crowing
over poirot but in the end i overcame the temptation this was a big business--i
had no right to play a lone hand and perhaps jeopardise our chances of
success for the first time we had stolen a march upon our enemies we
must make good this time--and disguise the fact as i might poirot had
the better brain of the two i wrote off post haste to him laying the facts before him and
explaining how urgent it was that we should overhear what went on at
the interview if he liked to leave it to me well and good but i gave
him detailed instructions how to reach the quarry from the station in
case he should deem it wise to be present himself i took the letter down to the village and posted it myself i had been
able to communicate with poirot throughout my stay by the simple
expedient of posting my letters myself but we had agreed that he
should not attempt to communicate with me in case my letters should be
tampered with i was in a glow of excitement the following evening no guests were
staying in the house and i was busy with mr ryland in his study all
the evening i had foreseen that this would be the case which was why
i had had no hope of being able to meet poirot at the station i was however confident that i would be dismissed well before eleven o'clock sure enough just after ten-thirty mr ryland glanced at the clock and announced that he was ""through "" i took the hint and retired
discreetly i went upstairs as though going to bed but slipped quietly
down a side staircase and let myself out into the garden having taken
the precaution to don a dark overcoat to hide my white shirt-front i had gone some way down the garden when i chanced to look over my
shoulder mr ryland was just stepping out from his study window into
the garden he was starting to keep the appointment i redoubled my
pace so as to get a clear start i arrived at the quarry somewhat out
of breath there seemed no one about and i crawled into a thick tangle
of bushes and awaited developments ten minutes later just on the stroke of eleven ryland stalked up his hat over his eyes and the inevitable cigar in his mouth he
gave a quick look round and then plunged into the hollows of the
quarry below presently i heard a low murmur of voices come up to me evidently the other man--or men--whoever they were had arrived first
at the rendezvous i crawled cautiously out of the bushes and inch
by inch using the utmost precaution against noise i wormed myself
down the steep path only a boulder now separated me from the talking
men secure in the blackness i peeped round the edge of it and found
myself facing the muzzle of a black murderous-looking automatic ""hands up "" said mr ryland succinctly ""i've been waiting for you ""
he was seated in the shadow of the rock so that i could not see his
face but the menace in his voice was unpleasant then i felt a ring of
cold steel on the back of my neck and ryland lowered his own automatic ""that's right george "" he drawled ""march him around here ""
raging inwardly i was conducted to a spot in the shadows where the
unseen george (whom i suspected of being the impeccable deaves) gagged
and bound me securely ryland spoke again in a tone which i had difficulty in recognising so
cold and menacing was it ""this is going to be the end of you two you've got in the way of the
big four once too often ever heard of land slides there was one about
here two years ago there's going to be another to-night i've fixed
that good and square say that friend of yours doesn't keep his dates
very punctually ""
a wave of horror swept over me poirot in another minute he would
walk straight into the trap and i was powerless to warn him i could
only pray that he had elected to leave the matter in my hands and had
remained in london surely if he had been coming he would have been
here by now with every minute that passed my hopes rose suddenly they were dashed to pieces i heard footsteps--cautious
footsteps but footsteps nevertheless i writhed in impotent agony they came down the path paused and then poirot himself appeared his
head a little on one side peering into the shadows i heard the growl of satisfaction ryland gave as he raised the big
automatic and shouted ""hands up "" deaves sprang forward as he did so and took poirot in the rear the ambush was complete ""please to meet you mr hercule poirot "" said the american grimly poirot's self-possession was marvellous he did not turn a hair but i
saw his eyes searching in the shadows ""my friend he is here ""
""yes you are both in the trap--the trap of the big four ""
he laughed ""a trap "" queried poirot ""say haven't you tumbled to it yet ""
""i comprehend that there is a trap--yes "" said poirot gently ""but you
are in error monsieur it is _you_ who are in it--not i and my
friend ""
""what "" ryland raised the big automatic but i saw his gaze falter ""if you fire you commit murder watched by ten pairs of eyes and you
will be hanged for it this place is surrounded--has been for the last
hour--by scotland yard men it is checkmate mr abe ryland ""
he uttered a curious whistle and as though by magic the place was
alive with men they seized ryland and the valet and disarmed them after speaking a few words to the officer in charge poirot took me by
the arm and led me away once clear of the quarry he embraced me with vigour ""you are alive--you are unhurt it is magnificent often have i blamed
myself for letting you go ""
""i'm perfectly all right "" i said disengaging myself ""but i'm just a
bit fogged you tumbled to their little scheme did you ""
""but i was waiting for it for what else did i permit you to go there your false name your disguise not for a moment was it intended to
deceive ""
""what "" i cried ""you never told me ""
""as i have frequently told you hastings you have a nature so
beautiful and so honest that unless you are yourself deceived it is
impossible for you to deceive others good then you are spotted
from the first and they do what i had counted on their doing--a
mathematical certainty to any one who uses his gray cells properly--use
you as a decoy they set the girl on--by the way _mon ami_ as an
interesting fact psychologically has she got red hair ""
""if you mean miss martin "" i said coldly ""her hair is a delicate shade
of auburn but--""
""they are _Ã©patant_--these people they have even studied your
psychology oh yes my friend miss martin was in the plot--very
much so she repeats the letter to you together with her tale of mr ryland's wrath you write it down you puzzle your brains--the cipher
is nicely arranged difficult but not too difficult--you solve it and
you send for me ""
""but what they do not know is that i am waiting for just this very
thing to happen i go post haste to japp and arrange things and so as
you see all is triumph ""
i was not particularly pleased with poirot and i told him so we went
back to london on a milk train in the early hours of the morning and a
most uncomfortable journey it was i was just out of my bath and indulging in pleasurable thoughts of
breakfast when i heard japp's voice in the sitting-room i threw on a
bathrobe and hurried in ""a pretty mare's nest you've got us into this time "" japp was saying ""it's too bad of you m poirot first time i've ever known you take a
toss ""
poirot's face was a study japp went on ""there were we taking all this black hand stuff seriously--and all the
time it was the footman ""
""the footman "" i gasped ""yes james or whatever his name is seems he laid 'em a wager in
the servants' hall that he could get taken for the old man by his
nibs--that's you captain hastings--and would hand him out a lot of spy
stuff about a big four gang ""
""impossible "" i cried ""don't you believe it i marched our gentleman straight to hatton
chase and there was the real ryland in bed and asleep and the butler
and the cook and god knows how many of them to swear to the wager just
a silly hoax--that's all it was--and the valet is with him ""
""so that was why he kept in the shadow "" murmured poirot after japp had gone we looked at each other ""we _know_ hastings "" said poirot at last ""number two of the big
four is abe ryland the masquerading on the part of the footman was to
ensure a way of retreat in case of emergencies and the footman--""
""yes "" i breathed ""_number four_ "" said poirot gravely "
Chapter 9,"9 the yellow jasmine mystery
it was all very well for poirot to say that we were acquiring
information all the time and gaining an insight into our adversaries'
minds--i felt myself that i required some more tangible success than
this since we had come into contact with the big four they had committed
two murders abducted halliday and had been within an ace of killing
poirot and myself; whereas so far we had hardly scored a point in the
game poirot treated my complaints lightly ""so far hastings "" he said ""they laugh that is true but you have a
proverb have you not: 'he laughs best who laughs at the end' and at
the end _mon ami_ you shall see ""you must remember too "" he added ""that we deal with no ordinary
criminal but with the second greatest brain in the world ""
i forbore to pander to his conceit by asking the obvious question i
knew the answer at least i knew what poirot's answer would be and
instead i tried without success to elicit some information as to what
steps he was taking to track down the enemy as usual he had kept me
completely in the dark as to his movements but i gathered that he was
in touch with secret service agents in india china and russia and from his occasional bursts of self-glorification that he was at least
progressing in his favourite game of gauging his enemy's mind he had abandoned his private practice almost entirely and i know that
at this time he refused some remarkably handsome fees true he would
sometimes investigate cases which intrigued him but he usually dropped
them the moment he was convinced that they had no connection with the
activities of the big four this attitude of his was remarkably profitable to our friend inspector
japp undeniably he gained much kudos for solving several problems
in which his success was really due to a half-contemptuous hint from
poirot in return for such service japp supplied full details of any case which
he thought might interest the little belgian and when he was put in
charge of what the newspaper called ""the yellow jasmine mystery "" he
wired poirot asking him whether he would care to come down and look
into the case it was in response to this wire that about a month after my adventure
in abe ryland's house we found ourselves alone in a railway
compartment whirling away from the smoke and dust of london bound for
the little town of market handford in worcestershire the seat of the
mystery poirot leant back in his corner ""and what exactly is your opinion of the affair hastings ""
i did not at once reply to his question; i felt the need of going
warily ""it all seems so complicated "" i said cautiously ""does it not "" said poirot delightedly ""i suppose our rushing off like this is a pretty clear sign that you
consider mr paynter's death to be murder--not suicide or the result of
an accident ""
""no no; you misunderstand me hastings granting that mr paynter died
as the result of a particularly terrible accident there are still a
number of mysterious circumstances to be explained ""
""that was what i meant when i said it was all so complicated ""
""let us go over all the main facts quietly and methodically recount
them to me hastings in an orderly and lucid fashion ""
i started forthwith endeavouring to be as orderly and lucid as i could ""we start "" i said ""with mr paynter a man of fifty-five rich cultured and somewhat of a globetrotter for the last twelve years
he has been little in england but suddenly tiring of incessant
travelling he bought a small place in worcestershire near market
handford and prepared to settle down his first action was to write
to his only relative a nephew gerald paynter the son of his younger
brother and to suggest to him that he should come and make his home
at croftlands (as the place is called) with his uncle gerald paynter who is an impecunious young artist was glad enough to fall in with the
arrangement and had been living with his uncle for about seven months
when the tragedy occurred ""
""your narrative style is masterly "" murmured poirot ""i say to myself it is a book that talks not my friend hastings ""
paying no attention to poirot i went on warming to the story ""mr paynter kept up a fair staff at croftlands--six servants as well
as his own chinese body servant--ah ling ""
""his chinese servant ah ling "" murmured poirot ""on tuesday last mr paynter complained of feeling unwell after
dinner and one of the servants was despatched to fetch the doctor mr paynter received the doctor in his study having refused to go to bed what passed between them was not then known but before doctor quentin
left he asked to see the housekeeper and mentioned that he had given
mr paynter a hypodermic injection as his heart was in a very weak
state recommended that he should not be disturbed and then proceeded
to ask some rather curious questions about the servants--how long they
had been there from whom they had come etc ""the housekeeper answered these questions as best she could but was
rather puzzled as to their purport a terrible discovery was made on
the following morning one of the housemaids on descending was met
by a sickening odour of burned flesh which seemed to come from her
master's study she tried the door but it was locked on the inside with the assistance of gerald paynter and the chinaman that was soon
broken in but a terrible sight greeted them mr paynter had fallen
forward into the gas fire and his face and head were charred beyond
recognition ""of course at the moment no suspicion was aroused as to its being
anything but a ghastly accident if blame attached to any one it was
to doctor quentin for giving his patient a narcotic and leaving him in
such a dangerous position and then a rather curious discovery was made ""there was a newspaper on the floor lying where it had slipped from
the old man's knees on turning it over words were found to be
scrawled across it feebly traced in ink a writing-table stood close
to the chair in which mr paynter had been sitting and the forefinger
of the victim's right hand was ink-stained up to the second joint it
was clear that too weak to hold a pen mr paynter had dipped his
finger in the ink-pot and managed to scrawl these two words across
the surface of the newspaper he held--but the words themselves seemed
utterly fantastic: _yellow jasmine_--just that and nothing more ""croftlands has a large quantity of yellow jasmine growing up its
walls and it was thought that this dying message had some reference to
them showing that the poor old man's mind was wandering of course the newspapers agog for anything out of the common took up the story
hotly calling it the mystery of the yellow jasmine--though in all
probability the words are completely unimportant ""
""they are unimportant you say "" said poirot ""well doubtless since
you say so it must be so ""
i regarded him dubiously but i could detect no mockery in his eye ""and then "" i continued ""there came the excitements of the inquest ""
""this is where you lick your lips i perceive ""
""there was a certain amount of feeling evidenced against dr quentin to begin with he was not the regular doctor only a locum putting in
a month's work whilst dr bolitho was away on a well-earned holiday then it was felt that his carelessness was the direct cause of the
accident but his evidence was little short of sensational mr paynter
had been ailing in health ever since his arrival at croftlands dr bolitho had attended him for some time but when dr quentin first saw
his patient he was mystified by some of the symptoms he had only
attended him once before the night when he was sent for after dinner as soon as he was alone with mr paynter the latter had unfolded a
surprising tale to begin with he was not feeling ill at all he
explained but the taste of some curry that he had been eating at
dinner had struck him as peculiar making an excuse to get rid of ah
ling for a few minutes he had turned the contents of his plate into a
bowl and he now handed it over to the doctor with injunctions to find
out if there were really anything wrong with it ""in spite of his statement that he was not feeling ill the doctor
noted that the shock of his suspicions had evidently affected him and that his heart was feeling it accordingly he administered an
injection--not of a narcotic but of strychnine ""that i think completes the case--except for _the_ crux of the
whole thing--the fact that the uneaten curry duly analysed was found
to contain enough powdered opium to have killed two men ""
i paused ""and your conclusions hastings "" asked poirot quietly ""it's difficult to say it _might_ be an accident--the fact that
some one attempted to poison him the same night might be merely a
coincidence ""
""but you don't think so you prefer to believe it--murder ""
""don't you ""
""_mon ami_ you and i do not reason in the same way i am not
trying to make up my mind between two opposite solutions--murder or
accident--that will come when we have solved the other problem--the
mystery of the 'yellow jasmine ' by the way you have left out
something there ""
""you mean the two lines at right angles to each other faintly indicated
under the words i did not think they could be of any possible
importance ""
""what you think is always so important to yourself hastings but let
us pass from the mystery of the yellow jasmine to the mystery of the
curry ""
""i know who poisoned it why there are a hundred questions one can
ask ah ling of course prepared it but why should he wish to kill
his master is he a member of a _tong_ or something like that one reads of such things the _tong_ of the yellow jasmine perhaps then there is gerald paynter ""
i came to an abrupt pause ""yes "" said poirot nodding his head ""there is gerald paynter as you
say he is his uncle's heir he was dining out that night though ""
""he might have got at some of the ingredients of the curry "" i
suggested ""and he would take care to be out so as not to have to
partake of the dish ""
i think my reasoning rather impressed poirot he looked at me with a
more respectful attention than he had given me so far ""he returns late "" i mused pursuing a hypothetical case ""sees the
light in his uncle's study enters and finding his plan has failed thrusts the old man down into the fire ""
""mr paynter who was a fairly hearty man of fifty-five would not
permit himself to be burnt to death without a struggle hastings such
a reconstruction is not feasible ""
""well poirot "" i cried ""we're nearly there i fancy let us hear what
you think ""
poirot threw me a smile swelled out his chest and began in a pompous
manner ""assuming murder the question at once arises why choose that
particular method i can think of only one reason--to confuse identity the face being charred beyond recognition ""
""what "" i cried ""you think--""
""a moment's patience hastings i was going on to say that i examine
that theory is there any ground for believing that the body is not
that of mr paynter is there any one else whose body it possibly could
be i examine these two questions and finally i answer them both in the
negative ""
""oh "" i said rather disappointed ""and then ""
poirot's eyes twinkled a little ""and then i say to myself 'since there is here something that i do not
understand it would be well that i should investigate the matter i
must not permit myself to be wholly engrossed by the big four ' ah we
are just arriving my little clothes brush where does it hide itself here it is--brush me down i pray you my friend and then i will
perform the same service for you ""
""yes "" said poirot thoughtfully as he put away the brush ""one must
not permit oneself to be obsessed by one idea i have been in danger of
that figure to yourself my friend that even here in this case i am
in danger of it those two lines you mentioned a downstroke and a line
at right angles to it what are they but the beginning of a 4 ""
""good gracious poirot "" i cried laughing ""is it not absurd i see the hand of the big four everywhere it is
well to employ one's wits in a totally different _milieu_ ah there is japp come to meet us """
Chapter 10,"10 we investigate at croftlands
the scotland yard inspector was indeed waiting on the platform and
greeted us warmly ""well moosior poirot this is good thought you'd like to be let in on
this tip-top mystery isn't it ""
i read this aright as showing japp to be completely puzzled and hoping
to pick up a pointer from poirot japp had a car waiting and we drove up in it to croftlands it was a
square white house quite unpretentious and covered with creepers including the starry yellow jasmine japp looked up at it as we did ""must have been balmy to go writing that poor old cove "" he remarked ""hallucinations perhaps and thought he was outside ""
poirot was smiling at him ""which was it my good japp "" he asked; ""accident or murder ""
the inspector seemed a little embarrassed by the question ""well if it weren't for that curry business i'd be for accident every
time there's no sense in holding a live man's head in the fire--why he'd scream the house down ""
""ah "" said poirot in a low voice ""fool that i have been triple
imbecile you are a cleverer man than i am japp ""
japp was rather taken aback by the compliment--poirot being usually
given to exclusive self praise he reddened and muttered something
about there being a lot of doubt about that he led the way through the house to the room where the tragedy had
occurred--mr paynter's study it was a wide low room with book-lined
walls and big leather arm-chairs poirot looked across at once to the window which gave upon a gravelled
terrace ""the window it was unlatched "" he asked ""that's the whole point of course when the doctor left this room he merely closed the door behind him the next morning it was found
locked who locked it mr paynter ah ling declares that the window
was closed and bolted dr quentin on the other hand has an
impression that it was closed but not fastened but he won't swear
either way if he could it would make a great difference if the man
_was_ murdered some one entered the room either through the door
or the window--if through the door it was an inside job; if through
the window it might have been any one first thing when they had
broken the door down they flung the window open and the housemaid
who did it thinks that it wasn't fastened but she's a precious bad
witness--will remember anything you ask her to ""
""what about the key ""
""there you are again it was on the floor among the wreckage of the
door might have fallen from the keyhole might have been dropped there
by one of the people who entered might have been slipped underneath
the door from the outside ""
""in fact everything is 'might have been' ""
""you've hit it moosior poirot that's just what it is ""
poirot was looking round him frowning unhappily ""i cannot see light "" he murmured ""just now---yes i got a gleam but
now all is darkness once more i have not the clue--the motive ""
""young gerald paynter had a pretty good motive "" remarked japp grimly ""he's been wild enough in his time i can tell you _and_
extravagant you know what artists are too--no morals at all ""
poirot did not pay much attention to japp's sweeping strictures on the
artistic temperament instead he smiled knowingly ""my good japp is it possible that you throw the mud in my eyes i know
well enough that it is the chinaman you suspect but you are so artful you want me to help you--and yet you drag the red kipper across the
trail ""
japp burst out laughing ""that's you all over mr poirot yes i'd bet on the chink i'll admit
it now it stands to reason that it was he who doctored the curry and
if he'd try once in an evening to get his master out of the way he'd
try twice ""
""i wonder if he would "" said poirot softly ""but it's the motive that beats me some heathen revenge or other i
suppose ""
""i wonder "" said poirot again ""there has been no robbery nothing has
disappeared no jewellery or money or papers ""
""no--that is not exactly ""
i pricked up my ears; so did poirot ""there's been no robbery i mean "" explained japp ""but the old
boy was writing a book of some sort we only knew about it this
morning when there was a letter from the publishers asking about the
manuscript it was just completed it seems young paynter and i have
searched high and low but can't find a trace of it--he must have
hidden it away somewhere ""
poirot's eyes were shining with the green light i knew so well ""how was it called this book "" he asked ""_the hidden hand in china_ i think it was called ""
""aha "" said poirot with almost a gasp then he said quickly ""let me
see the chinaman ah ling ""
the chinaman was sent for and appeared shuffling along with his eyes
cast down and his pigtail swinging his impassive face showed no trace
of any kind of emotion ""ah ling "" said poirot ""are you sorry your master is dead ""
""i welly sorry he good master ""
""you know who kill him ""
""i not know i tell pleeceman if i know ""
the questions and answers went on with the same impassive face ah
ling described how he had made the curry the cook had had nothing to
do with it he declared no hand had touched it but his own i wondered
if he saw where his admission was leading him he stuck to it too that the window to the garden was bolted that evening if it was open
in the morning his master must have opened it himself at last poirot
dismissed him ""that will do ah ling "" just as the chinaman had got to the door poirot recalled him ""and you know nothing you say of the yellow
jasmine ""
""no what should i know ""
""nor yet of the sign that was written underneath it ""
poirot leant forward as he spoke and quickly traced something on the
dust of a little table i was near enough to see it before he rubbed it
out a down stroke a line at right angles and then a second line down
which completed a big 4 the effect on the chinaman was electrical for
one moment his face was a mask of terror then as suddenly it was
impassive again and repeating his grave disclaimer he withdrew japp departed in search of young paynter and poirot and i were left
alone together ""the big four hastings "" cried poirot ""once again the big four paynter was a great traveller in his book there was doubtless some
vital information concerning the doings of number one li chang yen the head and brains of the big four ""
""but who--how--""
""hush here they come ""
gerald paynter was an amiable rather weak-looking young man he had
a soft brown beard and a peculiar flowing tie he answered poirot's
questions readily enough ""i dined out with some neighbours of ours the wycherlys "" he
explained ""what time did i get home oh about eleven i had a
latch-key you know all the servants had gone to bed and i naturally
thought my uncle had done the same as a matter of fact i did think i
caught sight of that soft-footed chinese beggar ah ling just whisking
round the corner of the hall but i fancy i was mistaken ""
""when did you last see your uncle mr paynter i mean before you came
to live with him ""
""oh not since i was a kid of ten he and his brother (my father)
quarrelled you know ""
""but he found you again with very little trouble did he not in spite
of all the years that had passed ""
""yes it was quite a bit of luck my seeing the lawyer's advertisement ""
poirot asked no more questions our next move was to visit dr quentin his story was substantially
the same as he had told at the inquest and he had little to add to
it he received us in his surgery having just come to the end of his
consulting patients he seemed an intelligent man a certain primness
of manner went well with his pince-nez but i fancied that he would be
thoroughly modern in his methods ""i wish i could remember about the window "" he said frankly ""but it's
dangerous to think back one becomes quite positive about something
that never existed that's psychology isn't it m poirot you see i've read all about your methods and i may say i'm an enormous admirer
of yours no i suppose it's pretty certain that the chinaman put the
powdered opium in the curry but he'll never admit it and we shall
never know why but holding a man down in a fire--that's not in keeping
with our chinese friend's character it seems to me ""
i commented on this last point to poirot as we walked down the main
street of market handford ""do you think he let a confederate in "" i asked ""by the way i suppose
japp can be trusted to keep an eye on him "" (the inspector had passed
into the police station on some business or other ) ""the emissaries of
the big four are pretty spry ""
""japp is keeping an eye on both of them "" said poirot grimly ""they
have been closely shadowed ever since the body was discovered ""
""well at any rate _we_ know that gerald paynter had nothing to do
with it ""
""you always know so much more than i do hastings that it becomes
quite fatiguing ""
""you old fox "" i laughed ""you never will commit yourself ""
""to be honest hastings the case is now quite clear to me--all but the
words _yellow jasmine_--and i am coming to agree with you that
they have no bearing on the crime in a case of this kind you have got
to make up your mind who is lying i have done that and yet--""
he suddenly darted from my side and entered an adjacent bookshop he
emerged a few minutes later hugging a parcel then japp rejoined us and we all sought quarters at the inn i slept late the next morning when i descended to the sitting-room
reserved for us i found poirot already there pacing up and down his
face contorted with agony ""do not converse with me "" he cried waving an agitated hand ""not
until i know that all is well--that the arrest is made ah but my
psychology has been weak hastings if a man writes a dying message it
is because it is important every one has said--'yellow jasmine there
is yellow jasmine growing up the house--it means nothing '""
""well what does it mean just what it says listen "" he held up a
little book he was holding ""my friend it struck me that it would be well to inquire into the
subject what exactly is yellow jasmine this little book has told me listen ""
he read ""'_gelsemini radix _ yellow jasmine composition: alkaloids
_gelseminine_ c_{22}h_{26}n_{2}o_{3} a potent poison acting like
coniine; _gelsemine_ c_{12}h_{14}no_{2} acting like strychnine;
_gelsemic acid_ etc gelsemium is a powerful depressant to the
central nervous system at a late stage in its action it paralyses the
motor nerve endings and in large doses causes giddiness and loss of
muscular power death is due to paralysis of the respiratory centre '
""you see hastings at the beginning i had an inkling of the truth when
japp made his remark about a live man being forced into the fire i
realised then that it was a dead man who was burned ""
""but why what was the point ""
""my friend if you were to shoot a man or stab a man after he were
dead or even knock him on the head it would be apparent that the
injuries were inflicted after death but with his head charred to a
cinder no one is going to hunt about for obscure causes of death and
a man who has apparently just escaped being poisoned at dinner is not
likely to be poisoned just afterwards _who_ is lying that is
always the question i decided to believe ah ling--""
""what "" i exclaimed ""you are surprised hastings ah ling knew of the existence of the
big four that was evident--so evident that it was clear he knew
nothing of their association with the crime until that moment had he
been the murderer he would have been able to retain his impassive
face perfectly so i decided then to believe ah ling and i fixed my
suspicions on gerald paynter it seemed to me that number four would
have found an impersonation of a long lost nephew very easy ""
""what "" i cried ""number four ""
""no hastings _not_ number four as soon as i had read up the
subject of yellow jasmine i saw the truth in fact it leapt to the
eye ""
""as always "" i said coldly ""it doesn't leap to mine ""
""because you will not use your little gray cells who had a chance to
tamper with the curry ""
""ah ling no one else ""
""no one else _what about the doctor _""
""but that was _afterwards_ ""
""of course it was afterwards there was no trace of powdered opium
in the curry served to mr paynter but acting in obedience to the
suspicions dr quentin had aroused the old man eats none of it and preserves it to give to his medical attendant whom he summons
according to plan dr quentin arrives takes charge of the curry _and gives mr paynter an injection_--of strychnine he says but really of yellow jasmine--a poisonous dose when the drug begins
to take effect he departs after unlatching the window then in the
night he returns by the window finds the manuscript and shoves mr paynter into the fire he does not heed the newspaper that drops to the
floor and is covered by the old man's body paynter knew what drug he
had been given and strove to accuse the big four of his murder it is
easy for quentin to mix powdered opium with the curry before handing it
over to be analysed he gives his version of the conversation with the
old man and mentions the strychnine injection casually in case the
mark of the hypodermic needle is noticed suspicion at once is divided
between accident and the guilt of ah ling owing to the poison in the
curry ""
""but dr quentin cannot be number four ""
""i fancy he can there is undoubtedly a real dr quentin who is
probably abroad somewhere number four has simply masqueraded as him
for a short time the arrangements with dr bolitho were all carried
out by correspondence the man who was to do locum originally having
been taken ill at the last minute ""
at that minute japp burst in very red in the face ""you have got him "" cried poirot anxiously japp shook his head very out of breath ""bolitho came back from his holiday this morning--recalled by
telegram no one knows who sent it the other man left last night we'll catch him yet though ""
poirot shook his head quietly ""i think not "" he said and absent-mindedly he drew a big 4 on the
table with a fork "
Chapter 11,"11 a chess problem
poirot and i often dined at a small restaurant in soho we were there
one evening when we observed a friend at an adjacent table it was
inspector japp and as there was room at our table he came and joined
us it was some time since either of us had seen him ""never do you stop in to see us nowadays "" declared poirot
reproachfully ""not since the affair of the yellow jasmine have we met and that is nearly a month ago ""
""i've been up north--that's why how are things with you big four
still going strong--eh ""
poirot shook a finger at him reproachfully ""ah you mock yourself at me--but the big four--they exist ""
""oh i don't doubt that--but they're not the hub of the universe as
you make out ""
""my friend you are very much mistaken the greatest power for evil in
the world to-day is this 'big four ' to what end they are tending no
one knows but there has never been another such criminal organisation the finest brain in china at the head of it an american millionaire and a french woman scientist as members and for the fourth--""
japp interrupted ""i know--i know regular bee in your bonnet over it all it's becoming
your little mania moosior poirot let's talk of something else for a
change take any interest in chess ""
""i have played it yes ""
""did you see that curious business yesterday match between two players
of world-wide reputation and one died during the game ""
""i saw a mention of it dr savaronoff the russian champion was one
of the players and the other who succumbed to heart failure was the
brilliant young american gilmour wilson ""
""quite right savaronoff beat rubenstein and became russian champion
some years ago wilson is said to be a second capablanca ""
""a very curious occurrence "" mused poirot ""if i mistake not you have
a particular interest in the matter ""
japp gave a rather embarrassed laugh ""you've hit it moosior poirot i'm puzzled wilson was sound as a
bell--no trace of heart trouble his death is quite inexplicable ""
""you suspect dr savaronoff of putting him out of the way "" i cried ""hardly that "" said japp dryly ""i don't think even a russian would
murder another man in order not to be beaten at chess--and anyway from
all i can make out the boot was likely to be on the other leg the
doctor is supposed to be very hot stuff--second to lasker they say he
is ""
poirot nodded thoughtfully ""then what exactly is your little idea "" he asked ""why should wilson
be poisoned for i assume of course that it is poison you suspect ""
""naturally heart failure means your heart stops beating--that's all
there is to that that's what a doctor says officially at the moment but privately he tips us the wink that he's not satisfied ""
""when is the autopsy to take place ""
""to-night wilson's death was extraordinarily sudden he seemed quite
as usual and was actually moving one of the pieces when he suddenly
fell forward--dead ""
""there are very few poisons would act in such a fashion "" objected
poirot ""i know the autopsy will help us i expect but why should any one
want gilmour wilson out of the way--that's what i'd like to know harmless unassuming young fellow just come over here from the states and apparently hadn't an enemy in the world ""
""it seems incredible "" i mused ""not at all "" said poirot smiling ""japp has his theory i can see ""
""i have moosior poirot i don't believe the poison was meant for
wilson--it was meant for the other man ""
""savaronoff ""
""yes savaronoff fell foul of the bolsheviks at the outbreak of the
revolution he was even reported killed in reality he escaped and
for three years endured incredible hardships in the wilds of siberia his sufferings were so great that he is now a changed man his friends
and acquaintances declare they would hardly have recognised him his
hair is white and his whole aspect that of a man terribly aged he is
a semi-invalid and seldom goes out living alone with a niece sonia
daviloff and a russian man-servant in a flat down westminster way it
is possible that he still considers himself a marked man certainly he
was very unwilling to agree to this chess contest he refused several
times point blank and it was only when the newspapers took it up
and began making a fuss about the 'unsportsmanlike refusal' that he
gave in gilmour wilson had gone on challenging him with real yankee
pertinacity and in the end he got his way now i ask you moosior
poirot why wasn't he willing because he didn't want attention drawn
to him didn't want somebody or other to get on his track that's my
solution--gilmour wilson got pipped by mistake ""
""there is no one who has any private reason to gain by savaronoff's
death ""
""well his niece i suppose he's recently come into an immense
fortune left him by madame gospoja whose husband was a sugar profiteer
under the old regime they had an affair together once i believe and
she refused steadfastly to credit the reports of his death ""
""where did the match take place ""
""in savaronoff's own flat he's an invalid as i told you ""
""many people there to watch it ""
""at least a dozen--probably more ""
poirot made an expressive grimace ""my poor japp your task is not an easy one ""
""once i know definitely that wilson was poisoned i can get on ""
""has it occurred to you that in the meantime supposing your
assumption that savaronoff was the intended victim to be correct the
murderer may try again ""
""of course it has two men are watching savaronoff's flat ""
""that will be very useful if any one should call with a bomb under his
arm "" said poirot dryly ""you're getting interested moosior poirot "" said japp with a twinkle ""care to come round to the mortuary and see wilson's body before the
doctors start on it who knows his tie-pin may be askew and that may
give you a valuable clue that will solve the mystery ""
""my dear japp all through dinner my fingers have been itching to
rearrange your own tie-pin you permit yes ah that is much more
pleasing to the eye yes by all means let us go to the mortuary ""
i could see that poirot's attention was completely captivated by this
new problem it was so long since he had shown any interest over any
outside case that i was quite rejoiced to see him back in his old form for my own part i felt a deep pity as i looked down upon the
motionless form and convulsed face of the hapless young american who
had come by his death in such a strange way poirot examined the body
attentively there was no mark on it anywhere except a small scar on
the left hand ""and the doctor says that's a burn not a cut "" explained japp poirot's attention shifted to the contents of the dead man's pockets
which a constable spread out for our inspection there was nothing
much--a handkerchief keys notecase filled with notes and some
unimportant letters but one object standing by itself filled poirot
with interest ""a chessman "" he exclaimed ""a white bishop was that in his pocket ""
""no clasped in his hand we had quite a difficulty to get it out of
his fingers it must be returned to dr savaronoff sometime it's part
of a very beautiful set of carved ivory chessmen ""
""permit me to return it to him it will make an excuse for my going
there ""
""aha "" cried japp ""so you want to come in on this case ""
""i admit it so skilfully have you aroused my interest ""
""that's fine got you away from your brooding captain hastings is
pleased too i can see ""
""quite right "" i said laughing poirot turned back towards the body ""no other little detail you can tell me about--him "" he asked ""i don't think so ""
""not even--that he was left-handed ""
""you're a wizard moosior poirot how did you know that he _was_
left-handed not that it's anything to do with the case ""
""nothing whatever "" agreed poirot hastily seeing that japp was
slightly ruffled ""my little joke--that was all i like to play you the
trick see you ""
we went out upon an amicable understanding the following morning saw us wending our way to dr savaronoff's flat
in westminster ""sonia daviloff "" i mused ""it's a pretty name ""
poirot stopped and threw me a look of despair ""always looking for romance you are incorrigible it would serve you
right if sonia daviloff turned out to be our friend and enemy the
countess vera rossakoff ""
at the mention of the countess my face clouded over ""surely poirot you don't suspect--""
""but no no it was a joke i have not the big four on the brain to
that extent whatever japp may say ""
the door of the flat was opened to us by a man-servant with a
peculiarly wooden face it seemed impossible to believe that that
impassive countenance could ever display emotion poirot presented a card on which japp had scribbled a few words of
introduction and we were shown into a low long room furnished with
rich hangings and curios one or two wonderful ikons hung upon the
walls and exquisite persian rugs lay upon the floor a samovar stood
upon a table i was examining one of the ikons which i judged to be of considerable
value and turned to see poirot prone upon the floor beautiful as the
rug was it hardly seemed to me to necessitate such close attention ""is it such a very wonderful specimen "" i asked ""eh oh the rug but no it was not the rug i was remarking but it
_is_ a beautiful specimen far too beautiful to have a large nail
wantonly driven through the middle of it no hastings "" as i came
forward ""the nail is not there now but the hole remains ""
a sudden sound behind us made me spin round and poirot spring nimbly
to his feet a girl was standing in the doorway her eyes full
upon us were dark with suspicion she was of medium height with a
beautiful rather sullen face dark blue eyes and very black hair
which was cut short her voice when she spoke was rich and sonorous and completely un-english ""i fear my uncle will be unable to see you he is a great invalid ""
""that is a pity but perhaps you will kindly help me instead you are
mademoiselle daviloff are you not ""
""yes i am sonia daviloff what is it you want to know ""
""i am making some inquiries about that sad affair the night before
last--the death of m gilmour wilson what can you tell me about it ""
the girl's eyes opened wide ""he died of heart failure--as he was playing chess ""
""the police are not so sure that it was--heart failure mademoiselle ""
the girl gave a terrified gesture ""it was true then "" she cried ""ivan was right ""
""who is ivan and why do you say he was right ""
""it was ivan who opened the door to you--and he has already said to me
that in his opinion gilmour wilson did not die a natural death--that he
was poisoned by mistake ""
""by mistake ""
""yes the poison was meant for my uncle ""
she had quite forgotten her first distrust now and was speaking
eagerly ""why do you say that mademoiselle who should wish to poison dr savaronoff ""
she shook her head ""i do not know i am all in the dark and my uncle he will not trust
me it is natural perhaps you see he hardly knows me he saw me as
a child and not since till i came to live with him here in london but this much i do know he is in fear of something we have many
secret societies in russia and one day i overheard something which
made me think it was of just such a society he went in fear tell me monsieur""--she came a step nearer and dropped her voice--""have you
ever heard of a society called the 'big four' ""
poirot jumped nearly out of his skin his eyes positively bulged with
astonishment ""why do you--what do you know of the big four mademoiselle ""
""there is such an association then i overheard a reference to them and asked my uncle about it afterwards never have i seen a man so
afraid he turned all white and shaking he was in fear of them monsieur in great fear i am sure of it and by mistake they killed
the american wilson ""
""the big four "" murmured poirot ""always the big four an astonishing
coincidence mademoiselle your uncle is still in danger i must save
him now recount to me exactly the events of that fatal evening show
me the chess-board the table how the two men sat--everything ""
she went to the side of the room and brought out a small table the
top of it was exquisite inlaid with squares of silver and black to
represent a chess-board ""this was sent to my uncle a few weeks ago as a present with the
request that he would use it in the next match he played it was in the
middle of the room--so ""
poirot examined the table with what seemed to me quite unnecessary
attention he was not conducting the inquiry at all as i would have
done many of his questions seemed to me pointless and upon really
vital matters he seemed to have no questions to ask i concluded that
the unexpected mention of the big four had thrown him completely off
his balance after a minute examination of the table and the exact position it had
occupied he asked to see the chessmen sonia daviloff brought them to
him in a box he examined one or two of them in a perfunctory manner ""an exquisite set "" he murmured absent-mindedly still not a question as to what refreshments there had been or what
people had been present i cleared my throat significantly ""don't you think poirot that--""
he interrupted me peremptorily ""do not think my friend leave all to me mademoiselle is it quite
impossible that i should see your uncle ""
a faint smile showed itself on her face ""he will see you yes you understand it is my part to interview all
strangers first ""
she disappeared i heard a murmur of voices in the next room and a
minute later she came back and motioned us to pass into the adjoining
room the man who lay there on a couch was an imposing figure tall gaunt with huge bushy eyebrows and white beard and a face haggard as the
result of starvation and hardships dr savaronoff was a distinct
personality i noted the peculiar formation of his head its unusual
height a great chess player must have a great brain i knew i could
easily understand dr savaronoff being the second greatest player in
the world poirot bowed ""m le docteur may i speak to you alone ""
savaronoff turned to his niece ""leave us sonia ""
she disappeared obediently ""now sir what is it ""
""dr savaronoff you have recently come into an enormous fortune if
you should--die unexpectedly who inherits it ""
""i have made a will leaving everything to my niece sonia daviloff you
do not suggest--""
""i suggest nothing but you have not seen your niece since she was a
child it would have been easy for any one to impersonate her ""
savaronoff seemed thunderstruck by the suggestion poirot went on
easily ""enough as to that i give you the word of warning that is all what
i want you to do now is to describe to me the game of chess the other
evening ""
""how do you mean--describe it ""
""well i do not play the chess myself but i understand that there are
various regular ways of beginning--the gambit do they not call it ""
dr savaronoff smiled a little ""ah i comprehend you now wilson opened ruy lopez--one of the soundest
openings there is and one frequently adopted in tournaments and
matches ""
""and how long had you been playing when the tragedy happened ""
""it must have been about the third or fourth move when wilson suddenly
fell forward over the table stone dead ""
poirot rose to depart he flung out his last question as though it was
of absolutely no importance but i knew better ""had he had anything to eat or drink ""
""a whisky and soda i think ""
""thank you dr savaronoff i will disturb you no longer ""
ivan was in the hall to show us out poirot lingered on the threshold ""the flat below this do you know who lives there ""
""sir charles kingwell a member of parliament sir it has been let
furnished lately though ""
""thank you ""
we went out into the bright winter sunlight ""well really poirot "" i burst out ""i don't think you've
distinguished yourself this time surely your questions were very
inadequate ""
""you think so hastings "" poirot looked at me appealingly ""i was
_bouleversÃ©_ yes what would you have asked ""
i considered the question carefully and then outlined my scheme to
poirot he listened with what seemed to be close interest my monologue
lasted until we had nearly reached home ""very excellent very searching hastings "" said poirot as he
inserted his key in the door and preceded me up the stairs ""but quite
unnecessary ""
""unnecessary "" i cried amazed ""if the man was poisoned--""
""aha "" cried poirot pouncing upon a note which lay on the table ""from
japp just as i thought "" he flung it over to me it was brief and to
the point no traces of poison had been found and there was nothing to
show how the man came by his death ""you see "" said poirot ""our questions would have been quite
unnecessary ""
""you guessed this beforehand ""
""'forecast the probable result of the deal '"" quoted poirot from a
recent bridge problem on which i had spent much time ""_mon ami_ when you do that successfully you do not call it guessing ""
""don't let's split hairs "" i said impatiently ""you foresaw this ""
""i did ""
""why ""
poirot put his hand into his pocket and pulled out--a white bishop ""why "" i cried ""you forgot to give it back to dr savaronoff ""
""you are in error my friend that bishop still reposes in my left-hand
pocket i took its fellow from the box of chessmen mademoiselle
daviloff kindly permitted me to examine the plural of one bishop is
two bishops ""
he sounded the final ""s"" with a great hiss i was completely mystified ""but why did you take it ""
""_parbleu_ i wanted to see if they were exactly alike ""
he stood them on the table side by side ""well they are of course "" i said ""exactly alike ""
poirot looked at them with his head on one side ""they seem so i admit but one should take no fact for granted until
it is proved bring me i pray you my little scales ""
with infinite care he weighed the two chessmen then turned to me with
a face alight with triumph ""i was right see you i was right impossible to deceive hercule
poirot ""
he rushed to the telephone--waited impatiently ""is that japp ah japp it is you hercule poirot speaks watch the
man-servant ivan on no account let him slip through your fingers yes yes it is as i say ""
he dashed down the receiver and turned to me ""you see it not hastings i will explain wilson was not poisoned he was electrocuted a thin metal rod passes up the middle of one
of those chessmen the table was prepared beforehand and set upon a
certain spot on the floor when the bishop was placed upon one of the
silver squares the current passed through wilson's body killing him
instantly the only mark was the electric burn upon his hand--his left
hand because he was left-handed the 'special table' was an extremely
cunning piece of mechanism the table i examined was a duplicate perfectly innocent it was substituted for the other immediately
after the murder the thing was worked from the flat below which if
you remember was let furnished but one accomplice at least was in
savaronoff's flat the girl is an agent of the big four working to
inherit savaronoff's money ""
""and ivan ""
""i strongly suspect that ivan is none other than the famous number
four ""
""_what _""
""yes the man is a marvellous character actor he can assume any part
he pleases ""
i thought back over past adventures the lunatic asylum keeper the
butcher's young man the suave doctor all the same man and all
totally unlike each other ""it's amazing "" i said at last ""everything fits in savaronoff had an
inkling of the plot and that's why he was so averse to playing the
match ""
poirot looked at me without speaking then he turned abruptly away and
began pacing up and down ""have you a book on chess by any chance _mon ami_ "" he asked
suddenly ""i believe i have somewhere ""
it took me some time to ferret it out but i found it at last and
brought it to poirot who sank down in a chair and started reading it
with the greatest attention in about a quarter of an hour the telephone rang i answered it it was
japp ivan had left the flat carrying a large bundle he had sprung
into a waiting taxi and the chase had begun he was evidently trying
to lose his pursuers in the end he seemed to fancy that he had done
so and had then driven to a big empty house at hampstead the house
was surrounded i recounted all this to poirot he merely stared at me as though he
scarcely took in what i was saying he held out the chess book ""listen to this my friend this is the ruy lopez opening 1 p-k4 p-k4; 2 kt-kb3 kt-qb3; 3b-kt5; then there comes a question as to
black's best third move he has the choice of various defences it was
white's third move that killed gilmour wilson 3b-kt5 only the third
move--does that say nothing to you ""
i hadn't the least idea what he meant and told him so ""i suppose hastings that while you were sitting in this chair you
heard the front door being opened and shut what would you think ""
""i should think some one had gone out i suppose ""
""yes--but there are always two ways of looking at things some one gone
out--some one come _in_--two totally different things hastings but if you assumed the wrong one presently some little discrepancy
would creep in and show you that you were on the wrong track ""
""what does all this mean poirot ""
poirot sprang to his feet with sudden energy ""it means that i have been a triple imbecile quick quick to the flat
in westminster we may yet be in time ""
we tore off in a taxi poirot returned no answer to my excited
questions we raced up the stairs repeated rings and knocks brought no
reply but listening closely i could distinguish a hollow groan coming
from within the hall porter proved to have a master key and after a few
difficulties he consented to use it poirot went straight to the inner room a whiff of chloroform met us on the floor was sonia daviloff gagged and bound with a great wad of
saturated cotton wool over her nose and mouth poirot tore it off and
began to take measures to restore her presently a doctor arrived and
poirot handed her over to his charge and drew aside with me there was
no sign of dr savaronoff ""what does it all mean "" i asked bewildered ""it means that before two equal deductions i chose the wrong one you
heard me say that it would be easy for any one to impersonate sonia
daviloff because her uncle had not seen her for so many years ""
""yes ""
""well precisely the opposite held good also it was equally easy for
any one to impersonate the uncle ""
""what ""
""savaronoff _did_ die at the outbreak of the revolution the man
who pretended to have escaped with such terrible hardships the man so
changed 'that his own friends could hardly recognise him ' the man who
successfully laid claim to an enormous fortune--""
""yes who was he ""
""_number four _ no wonder he was frightened when sonia let him
know she had overheard one of his private conversations about the 'big
four ' again he has slipped through my fingers he guessed i should
get on the right track in the end so he sent off the honest ivan
on a tortuous wild goose chase chloroformed the girl and got out having by now doubtless realised most of the securities left by madame
gospoja ""
""but--but who tried to kill him then ""
""nobody tried to kill _him_ wilson was the intended victim all
along ""
""but why ""
""my friend savaronoff was the second greatest chess player in the
world in all probability number four did not even know the rudiments
of the game certainly he could not sustain the fiction of a match he tried all he knew to avoid the contest when that failed wilson's
doom was sealed at all costs he must be prevented from discovering
that the great savaronoff did not even know how to play chess wilson
was fond of the ruy lopez opening and was certain to use it number
four arranged for death to come with the third move before any
complications of defence set in ""
""but my dear poirot "" i persisted ""are we dealing with a lunatic i
quite follow your reasoning and admit that you must be right but to
kill a man just to sustain his rÃ´le surely there were simpler ways out
of the difficulty than that he could have said that his doctor forbade
the strain of a match ""
poirot wrinkled his forehead ""_certainement_ hastings "" he said ""there were other ways but
none so convincing besides you are assuming that to kill a man is a
thing to avoid are you not number four's mind it does not act that
way i put myself in his place a thing impossible for you i picture
his thoughts he enjoys himself as the professor at that match i doubt
not he has visited the chess tourneys to study his part he sits and
frowns in thought; he gives the impression that he is thinking great
plans and all the time he laughs in himself he is aware that two
moves are all that he knows--and all that he _need know_ again it would appeal to his mind to foresee the events and to make the man
his own executioner at the exact time that suits number four oh yes hastings i begin to understand our friend and his psychology ""
i shrugged ""well i suppose you're right but i can't understand any one running a
risk he could so easily avoid ""
""risk "" poirot snorted ""where then lay the risk would japp have
solved the problem no; if number four had not made one small mistake
he would have run no risk ""
""and his mistake "" i asked although i suspected the answer ""_mon ami_ he overlooked the little gray cells of hercule poirot ""
poirot has his virtues but modesty is not one of them "
Chapter 12,"12 the baited trap
it was mid-january--a typical english winter day in london damp and
dirty poirot and i were sitting in two chairs well drawn up to the
fire i was aware of my friend looking at me with a quizzical smile the meaning of which i could not fathom ""a penny for your thoughts "" i said lightly ""i was thinking my friend that at midsummer when you first arrived you told me that you proposed to be in this country for a couple of
months only ""
""did i say that "" i asked rather awkwardly ""i don't remember ""
poirot's smile broadened ""you did _mon ami_ since then you have changed your plan is it
not so ""
""er--yes i have ""
""and why is that ""
""dash it all poirot you don't think i'm going to leave you all alone
when you're up against a thing like the 'big four ' do you ""
poirot nodded gently ""just as i thought you are a staunch friend hastings it is to serve
me that you remain on here and your wife--little cinderella as you
call her what does she say ""
""i haven't gone into details of course but she understands she'd be
the last one to wish me to turn my back on a pal ""
""yes yes she too is a loyal friend but it is going to be a long
business perhaps ""
i nodded rather discouraged ""six months already "" i mused ""and where are we you know poirot i
can't help thinking that we ought to--well to do something ""
""always so energetic hastings and what precisely would you have me
do ""
this was somewhat of a poser but i was not going to withdraw from my
position ""we ought to take the offensive "" i urged ""what have we done all this
time ""
""more than you think my friend after all we have established the
identity of number two and number three and we have learnt more than a
little about the ways and methods of number four ""
i brightened up a little as poirot put it things didn't sound so bad ""oh yes hastings we have done a great deal it is true that i am
not in a position to accuse either ryland or madame olivier--who would
believe me you remember i thought once i had ryland successfully
cornered nevertheless i have made my suspicions known in certain
quarters--the highest--lord aldington who enlisted my help in the
matter of the stolen submarine plans is fully cognisant of all my
information respecting the big four--and while others may doubt he
believes ryland and madame olivier and li chang yen himself may go
their ways but there is a searchlight turned on all their movements ""
""and number four "" i asked ""as i said just now--i am beginning to know and understand his methods you may smile hastings--but to penetrate a man's personality to
know exactly what he will do under any given circumstances--that is
the beginning of success it is a duel between us and whilst he is
constantly giving away his mentality to me i endeavour to let him
know little or nothing of mine he is in the light i in the shade i
tell you hastings that every day they fear me the more for my chosen
inactivity ""
""they've let us alone anyway "" i observed ""there have been no more
attempts on your life and no ambushes of any kind ""
""no "" said poirot thoughtfully ""on the whole that rather surprises
me especially as there are one or two fairly obvious ways of getting
at us which i should have thought certain to have occurred to them you
catch my meaning perhaps ""
""an infernal machine of some kind "" i hazarded poirot made a sharp click with his tongue expressive of impatience ""but no i appeal to your imagination and you can suggest nothing
more subtle than bombs in the fireplace well well i have need of
some matches i will promenade myself despite the weather pardon my friend but is it possible that you read _the future of the
argentine_ _mirror of society_ _cattle breeding_ _the
clue of crimson_ and _sport in the rockies_ at one and the same
time ""
i laughed and admitted that _the clue of crimson_ was at present
engaging my sole attention poirot shook his head sadly ""but replace then the others on the bookshelf never never shall i
see you embrace the order and the method mon dieu what then is a
bookshelf for ""
i apologised humbly and poirot after replacing the offending volumes each in its appointed place went out and left me to uninterrupted
enjoyment of my selected book i must admit however that i was half asleep when mrs pearson's knock
at the door aroused me ""a telegram for you captain ""
i tore the orange envelope open without much interest then i sat as though turned to stone it was a cable from bronsen my manager out at the south american
ranch and it ran as follows:--
 ""mrs hastings disappeared yesterday feared been kidnapped by some
 gang calling itself big four cable instructions have notified police
 but no clue as yet ""
 bronsen i waved mrs pearson out of the room and sat as though stunned reading the words over and over again cinderella--kidnapped in the
hands of the infamous big four god what could i do poirot i must have poirot he would advise me he would checkmate them
somehow in a few minutes now he would be back i must wait patiently
until then but cinderella--in the hands of the big four another knock mrs pearson put her head in once more ""a note for you captain--brought by a heathen chinaman he's a-waiting
downstairs ""
i seized it from her it was brief and to the point ""if you ever wish to see your wife again go with the bearer of this
note immediately leave no message for your friend or she will suffer ""
it was signed with a big 4 what ought i to have done what would you who read have done in my
place i had no time to think i saw only one thing--cinderella in the power
of those devils i must obey--i dare not risk a hair of her head i
must go with this chinaman and follow whither he led it was a trap yes and it meant certain capture and possible death but it was baited
with the person dearest to me in the whole world and i dared not
hesitate what irked me most was to leave no word for poirot once set him on
my track and all might yet be well dare i risk it apparently i was
under no supervision but yet i hesitated it would have been so easy
for the chinaman to come up and assure himself that i was keeping to
the letter of the command why didn't he his very abstention made me
more suspicious i had seen so much of the omnipotence of the big four
that i credited them with almost super-human powers for all i know even the little bedraggled servant girl might be one of their agents no i dared not risk it but one thing i could do leave the telegram he would know then that cinderella had disappeared and who was
responsible for her disappearance all this passed through my head in less time than it takes to tell and
i had clapped my hat on my head and was descending the stairs to where
my guide waited in a little over a minute the bearer of the message was a tall impassive chinaman neatly but
rather shabbily dressed he bowed and spoke to me his english was
perfect but he spoke with a slight sing-song intonation ""you captain hastings ""
""yes "" i said ""you give me note please ""
i had foreseen the request and handed him over the scrap of paper
without a word but that was not all ""you have telegram to-day yes come along just now from south
america yes ""
i realised anew the excellence of their espionage system--or it might
have been a shrewd guess bronsen was bound to cable me they would
wait until the cable was delivered and would strike hard upon it no good could come of denying what was palpably true ""yes "" i said ""i did get a telegram ""
""you fetch him yes fetch him now ""
i ground my teeth but what could i do i ran upstairs again as i
did so i thought of confiding in mrs pearson at any rate as far as
cinderella's disappearance went she was on the landing but close
behind her was the little maid-servant and i hesitated if she
_was_ a spy--the words of the note danced before my eyes "" she
will suffer "" i passed into the sitting-room without speaking i took up the telegram and was about to pass out again when an idea
struck me could i not leave some sign which would mean nothing
to my enemies but which poirot himself would find significant i
hurried across to the bookcase and tumbled out four books on to the
floor no fear of poirot's not seeing them they would outrage his
eyes immediately--and coming on top of his little lecture surely
he would find them unusual next i put a shovelful of coal on the
fire and managed to spill four knobs into the grate i had done all i
could--pray heaven poirot would read the sign aright i hurried down again the chinaman took the telegram from me read it then placed it in his pocket and with a nod beckoned me to follow him it was a long weary march that he led me once we took a bus and once
we went for some considerable way in a train and always our route led
us steadily eastward we went through strange districts the existence
of which i had never dreamed of we were down by the docks now i knew and i realised that i was being taken into the heart of chinatown in spite of myself i shivered still my guide plodded on turning and
twisting through mean streets and byways until at last he stopped at a
dilapidated house and rapped four times upon the door it was opened immediately by another chinaman who stood aside to let us
pass in the clanging to of the door behind me was the knell of my last
hopes i was indeed in the hands of the enemy i was now handed over to the second chinaman he led me down some
rickety stairs and into a cellar which was filled with bales and casks
and which exhaled a pungent odour as of eastern spices i felt wrapped
all round with the atmosphere of the east tortuous cunning sinister--
suddenly my guide rolled aside two of the casks and i saw a low
tunnel-like opening in the wall he motioned me to go ahead the tunnel
was of some length and it was just too low for me to stand upright at
last however it broadened out into a passage and a few minutes later
we stood in another cellar my chinaman went forward and rapped four times on one of the walls a
whole section of the wall swung out leaving a narrow doorway i passed
through and to my utter astonishment found myself in a kind of arabian
nights' palace a low long subterranean chamber hung with rich oriental
silks brilliantly lighted and fragrant with perfumes and spices there five or six silk covered divans and exquisite carpets of chinese
workmanship covered the ground at the end of the room was a curtained
recess from behind these curtains came a voice ""you have brought our honoured guest ""
""excellency he is here "" replied my guide ""let our guest enter "" was the answer at the same moment the curtains were drawn aside by an unseen hand and i was facing an immense cushioned divan on which sat a tall thin
oriental dressed in wonderfully embroidered robes and clearly by the
length of his finger nails a great man ""be seated i pray you captain hastings "" he said with a wave of his
hand ""you acceded to my request to come immediately i am glad to see ""
""who are you "" i asked ""li chang yen ""
""indeed no i am but the humblest of the master's servants i carry
out his behests that is all--as do other of his servants in other
countries--in south america for instance ""
i advanced a step ""where is she what have you done with her out there ""
""she is in a place of safety--where none will find her as yet she is
unharmed you observe that i say--_as yet_ ""
cold shivers ran down my spine as i confronted this smiling devil ""what do you want "" i cried ""money ""
""my dear captain hastings we have no designs on your small savings i
can assure you not--pardon me--a very intelligent suggestion on your
part your colleague would not have made it i fancy ""
""i suppose "" i said heavily ""you wanted to get me into your toils well you have succeeded i have come here with my eyes open do what
you like with me and let her go she knows nothing and she can be no
possible use to you you've used her to get hold of me--you've got me
all right and that settles it ""
the smiling oriental caressed his smooth cheek watching me obliquely
out of his narrow eyes ""you go too fast "" he said purringly ""that does not quite--settle it in fact to 'get hold of you' as you express it is not really our
objective but through you we hope to get hold of your friend m hercule poirot ""
""i'm afraid you won't do that "" i said with a short laugh ""what i suggest is this "" continued the other his words running on as
though he had not heard me ""you will write m hercule poirot a letter such a letter as will
induce him to hasten hither and join you ""
""i shall do no such thing "" i said angrily ""the consequences of refusal will be disagreeable ""
""damn your consequences ""
""the alternative might be death ""
a nasty shiver ran down my spine but i endeavoured to put a bold face
upon it ""it's no good threatening me and bullying me keep your threats for
chinese cowards ""
""my threats are very real ones captain hastings i ask you again will
you write this letter ""
""i will not and what's more you daren't kill me you'd have the
police on your tracks in no time ""
my interlocutor clapped his hands swiftly two chinese attendants
appeared as it were out of the blue and pinioned me by both arms their master said something rapidly to them in chinese and they
dragged me across the floor to a spot in one corner of the big chamber one of them stooped and suddenly without the least warning the
flooring gave beneath my feet but for the restraining hand of the
other man i should have gone down the yawning gap beneath me it was
inky black and i could hear the rushing of water ""the river "" said my questioner from his place on the divan ""think
well captain hastings if you refuse again you go headlong to
eternity to meet your death in the dark waters below for the last
time will you write that letter ""
i'm not braver than most men i admit frankly that i was scared to
death and in a blue funk that chinese devil meant business i was
sure of that it was good-bye to the good old world in spite of
myself my voice wobbled a little as i answered ""for the last time no to hell with your letter ""
then involuntarily i closed my eyes and breathed a short prayer "
Chapter 13,"13 the mouse walks in
not often in a life-time does a man stand on the edge of eternity but when i spoke those words in that east end cellar i was perfectly
certain that they were my last words on earth i braced myself for
the shock of those black rushing waters beneath and experienced in
advance the horror of that breath-choking fall but to my surprise a low laugh fell on my ears i opened my eyes obeying a sign from the man on the divan my two jailers brought me
back to my old seat facing him ""you are a brave man captain hastings "" he said ""we of the east
appreciate bravery i may say that i expected you to act as you have
done that brings us to the appointed second act of our little drama death for yourself you have faced--will you face death for another ""
""what do you mean "" i asked hoarsely a horrible fear creeping over me ""surely you have not forgotten the lady who is in our power--the rose
of the garden ""
i stared at him in dumb agony ""i think captain hastings that you will write that letter see i
have a cable form here the message i shall write on it depends on you and means life or death for your wife ""
the sweat broke out on my brow my tormentor continued smiling
amiably and speaking with perfect sangfroid:--
""there captain the pen is ready to your hand you have only to write if not--""
""if not "" i echoed ""if not that lady that you love dies--and dies slowly my master li chang yen amuses himself in his spare hours by devising new and
ingenious methods of tortures--""
""my god "" i cried ""you fiend not that--you wouldn't do that--""
""shall i recount to you some of his devices ""
without heeding my cry of protest his speech flowed on--evenly serenely--till with a cry of horror i clapped my hands to my ears ""it is enough i see take up the pen and write ""
""you would not dare--""
""your speech is foolishness and you know it take up the pen and
write ""
""if i do ""
""your wife goes free the cable shall be despatched immediately ""
""how do i know that you will keep faith with me ""
""i swear it to you on the sacred tombs of my ancestors moreover judge
for yourself--why should i wish to do her harm her detention will have
answered its purpose ""
""and--and poirot ""
""we will keep him in safe custody until we have concluded our
operations then we will let him go ""
""will you swear that also on the tombs of your ancestors ""
""i have sworn one oath to you that should be sufficient ""
my heart sank i was betraying my friend--to what for a moment i
hesitated--then the terrible alternative rose like a nightmare before
my eyes cinderella--in the hands of these chinese devils dying by
slow torture--
a groan rose to my lips i seized the pen perhaps by careful wording
of the letter i could convey a warning and poirot would be enabled to
avoid the trap it was the only hope but even that hope was not to remain the chinaman's voice rose suave
and courteous ""permit me to dictate to you ""
he paused consulted a sheaf of notes that lay by his side and then
dictated as follows:--
 ""dear poirot i think i'm on the track of number four a chinaman
 came this afternoon and lured me down here with a bogus message luckily i saw through his little game in time and gave him the
 slip then i turned the tables on him and managed to do a bit of
 shadowing on my own account--rather neatly too i flatter myself i'm getting a bright young lad to carry this to you give him a
 half a crown will you that's what i promised him if it was
 delivered safely i'm watching the house and daren't leave i
 shall wait for you until six o'clock and if you haven't come then i'll have a try at getting into the house on my own it's too good
 a chance to miss and of course the boy mightn't find you but
 if he does get him to bring you down here right away and cover
 up those precious moustaches of yours in case any one's watching
 out from the house and might recognise you ""yours in haste ""a h ""
every word that i wrote plunged me deeper in despair the thing was
diabolically clever i realised how closely every detail of our life
must be known it was just such an epistle as i might have penned
myself the acknowledgment that the chinaman who had called that
afternoon had endeavoured to ""lure me away"" discounted any good i might
have done by leaving my ""sign"" of four books it _had_ been a
trap and i had seen through it that was what poirot would think the
time too was cleverly planned poirot on receiving the note would
have just time to rush off with his innocent-looking guide and that
he would do so i knew my determination to make my way into the house
would bring him post haste he always displayed a ridiculous distrust
of my capacities he would be convinced that i was running into danger
without being equal to the situation and would rush down to take
command of the situation but there was nothing to be done i wrote as bidden my captor took the
note from me read it then nodded his head approvingly and handed it
to one of the silent attendants who disappeared with it behind one of
the silken hangings on the wall which masked a doorway with a smile the man opposite to me picked up a cable form and wrote he handed it to me it read: ""release the white bird with all despatch ""
i gave a sigh of relief ""you will send it at once "" i urged he smiled and shook his head ""when m hercule poirot is in my hands it shall be sent not until
then ""
""but you promised--""
""if this device fails i may have need of our white bird--to persuade
you to further efforts ""
i grew white with anger ""my god if you--""
he waved a long slim yellow hand ""be reassured i do not think it will fail and the moment m poirot is
in our hands i will keep my oath ""
""if you play me false ""
""i have sworn it by my honoured ancestors have no fear rest here
awhile my servants will see to your needs whilst i am absent ""
i was left alone in this strange underground nest of luxury the second
chinese attendant had reappeared one of them brought food and drink
and offered it to me but i waved them aside i was sick--sick--at
heart--
and then suddenly the master reappeared tall and stately in his silken
robes he directed operations by his orders i was hustled back through
the cellar and tunnel into the original house i had entered there they
took me into a ground floor room the windows were shuttered but one
could see through the cracks into the street an old ragged man was
shuffling along the opposite side of the road and when i saw him make
a sign to the window i understood that he was one of the gang on watch ""it is well "" said my chinese friend ""hercule poirot has fallen into
the trap he approaches now--and alone except for the boy who guides
him now captain hastings you have still one more part to play unless you show yourself he will not enter the house when he arrives
opposite you must go out on the step and beckon him in ""
""what "" i cried revolted ""you play that part alone remember the price of failure if hercule
poirot suspects anything is amiss and does not enter the house your
wife dies by the seventy lingering deaths ah here he is ""
with a beating heart and a feeling of deathly sickness i looked
through the crack in the shutters in the figure walking along the
opposite side of the street i recognised my friend at once though his
coat collar was turned up and an immense yellow muffler hid the bottom
part of his face but there was no mistaking that walk and the poise
of that egg-shaped head it was poirot coming to my aid in all good faith suspecting nothing
amiss by his side ran a typical london urchin grimy of face and
ragged of apparel poirot paused looking across at the house whilst the boy spoke to him
eagerly and pointed it was the time for me to act i went out in the
hall at a sign from the tall chinaman one of the servants unlatched
the door ""remember the price of failure "" said my enemy in a low voice i was outside on the steps i beckoned to poirot he hastened across ""aha so all is well with you my friend i was beginning to be
anxious you managed to get inside is the house empty then ""
""yes "" i said in a voice i strove to make natural ""there must be a
secret way out of it somewhere come in and let us look for it ""
i stepped back across the threshold in all innocence poirot prepared
to follow me and then something seemed to snap in my head i saw only too clearly
the part i was playing--the part of judas ""back poirot "" i cried ""back for your life it's a trap never mind
me get away at once ""
even as i spoke--or rather shouted my warning hands gripped me like a
vice one of the chinese servants sprang past me to grab poirot i saw the latter spring back his arm raised then suddenly a dense
volume of smoke was rising round me choking me--killing me--
i felt myself falling--suffocating--this was death--
 * * * * *
i came to myself slowly and painfully--all my senses dazed the first
thing i saw was poirot's face he was sitting opposite me watching me
with an anxious face he gave a cry of joy when he saw me looking at
him ""ah you revive--you return to yourself all is well my friend--my
poor friend ""
""where am i "" i said painfully ""where but _chez vous_ ""
i looked round me true enough i was in the old familiar surroundings and in the grate were the identical four knobs of coal i had carefully
spilt there poirot had followed my glance ""but yes that was a famous idea of yours--that and the books see
you if they should say to me any time 'that friend of yours that
hastings he has not the great brain is it not so ' i shall reply to
them: 'you are in error ' it was an idea magnificent and superb that
occurred to you there ""
""you understood their meaning then ""
""am i an imbecile of course i understood it gave me just the warning
i needed and the time to mature my plans somehow or other the big
four had carried you off with what object clearly not for your
_beaux yeux_--equally clearly not because they feared you and
wanted to get you out of the way no their object was plain you would
be used as a decoy to get the great hercule poirot into their clutches i have long been prepared for something of the kind i make my little
preparations and presently sure enough the messenger arrives--such
an innocent little street urchin me i swallow everything and hasten
away with him and very fortunately they permit you to come out on
the doorstep that was my one fear that i should have to dispose of
them before i had reached the place where you were concealed and that
i should have to search for you--perhaps in vain--afterwards ""
""dispose of them did you say "" i asked feebly ""single-handed ""
""oh there is nothing very clever about that if one is prepared in
advance all is simple--the motto of the boy scout is it not and
a very fine one me i was prepared not so long ago i rendered a
service to a very famous chemist who did a lot of work in connection
with poison gas during the war he devised for me a little bomb--simple
and easy to carry about--one has but to throw it and poof the
smoke--and then the unconsciousness immediately i blow a little
whistle and straightway some of japp's clever fellows who were watching
the house here long before the boy arrived and who managed to follow
us all the way to limehouse came flying up and took charge of the
situation ""
""but how was it you weren't unconscious too ""
""another piece of luck our friend number four (who certainly
composed that ingenious letter) permitted himself a little jest at
my moustaches which rendered it extremely easy for me to adjust my
respirator under the guise of a yellow muffler ""
""i remember "" i cried eagerly and then with the word ""remember"" all
the ghastly horror that i had temporarily forgotten came back to me _cinderella_--
i fell back with a groan i must have lost consciousness again for a minute or two i awoke to
find poirot forcing some brandy between my lips ""what is it _mon ami_ but what is it--then tell me "" word by
word i got the thing told shuddering as i did so poirot uttered a
cry ""my friend my friend but what you must have suffered and i who knew
nothing of all this but reassure yourself all is well ""
""you will find her you mean but she is in south america and by the
time we get there--long before she will be dead--and god knows how and
in what horrible way she will have died ""
""no no you do not understand she is safe and well she has never
been in their hands for one instant ""
""but i got a cable from bronsen ""
""no no you did not you may have got a cable from south america
signed bronsen--that is a very different matter tell me has it never
occurred to you that an organisation of this kind with ramifications
all over the world might easily strike at us through that little girl cinderella whom you love so well ""
""no never "" i replied ""well it did to me i said nothing to you because i did not want to
upset you unnecessarily--but i took measures of my own your wife's
letters all seem to have been written from the ranch but in reality
she has been in a place of safety devised by me for over three months ""
i looked at him for a long time ""you are sure of that ""
""_parbleu _ i know it they tortured you with a lie ""
i turned my head aside poirot put his hand on my shoulder there was
something in his voice that i had never heard there before ""you like not that i should embrace you or display the emotion i know
well i will be very british i will say nothing--but nothing at all only this--that in this last adventure of ours the honours are all
with you and happy is the man who has such a friend as i have """
Chapter 14,"14 the peroxide blonde
i was very disappointed with the results of poirot's bomb attack on
the premises in chinatown to begin with the leader of the gang had
escaped when japp's men rushed up in response to poirot's whistle
they found four chinamen unconscious in the hall but the man who had
threatened me with death was not among them i remembered afterwards
that when i was forced out on to the doorstep to decoy poirot into the
house this man had kept well in the background presumably he was out
of the danger zone of the gas bomb and made good his escape by one of
the many exits which we afterwards discovered from the four who remained in our hands we learnt nothing the fullest
investigation by the police failed to bring to light anything to
connect them with the big four they were ordinary low-class residents
of the district and they professed bland ignorance of the name li
chang yen a chinese gentleman had hired them for service in the house
by the waterside and they knew nothing whatever of his private affairs by the next day i had except for a slight headache completely
recovered from the effects of poirot's gas bomb we went down together
to chinatown and searched the house from which i had been rescued the premises consisted of two ramshackle houses joined together by an
underground passage the ground floors and the upper stories of each
were unfurnished and deserted the broken windows covered by decaying
shutters japp had already been prying about in the cellars and had
discovered the secret of the entrance to the subterranean chamber
where i had spent such an unpleasant half-hour closer investigation
confirmed the impression that it had made on me the night before the
silks on the walls and divan and the carpets on the floors were of
exquisite workmanship although i know very little about chinese art i
could appreciate that every article in the room was perfect of its kind with the aid of japp and some of his men we conducted a most thorough
search of the apartment i had cherished high hopes that we would
find documents of importance a list perhaps of some of the more
important agents of the big four or cipher notes of some of their
plans but we discovered nothing of the kind the only papers we found
in the whole place were the notes which the chinaman had consulted
whilst he was dictating the letter to poirot these consisted of a very
complete record of each of our careers and estimate of our characters and suggestions about the weaknesses through which we might best be
attacked poirot was most childishly delighted with this discovery personally i
could not see that it was of any value whatever especially as whoever
compiled the notes was ludicrously mistaken in some of his opinions i
pointed this out to my friend when we were back in our rooms ""my dear poirot "" i said ""you know now what the enemy thinks of us he
appears to have a grossly exaggerated idea of your brain power and to
have absurdly underrated mine but i do not see how we are better off
for knowing this ""
poirot chuckled in rather an offensive way ""you do not see hastings no but surely now we can prepare ourselves
for some of their methods of attack now that we are warned of some
of our faults for instance my friend we know that you should think
before you act again if you meet a red-haired young woman in trouble
you should eye her--what you say--askance is it not ""
their notes had contained some absurd references to my supposed
impulsiveness and had suggested that i was susceptible to the charms
of young women with hair of a certain shade i thought poirot's
reference to be in the worst of taste but fortunately i was able to
counter him ""and what about you "" i demanded ""are you going to try to cure your
'overweening vanity ' your 'finicky tidiness '""
i was quoting and i could see that he was not pleased with my retort ""oh without doubt hastings in some things they deceive
themselves--_tant mieux_ they will learn in due time meanwhile
we have learnt something and to know is to be prepared ""
this last was a favourite axiom of his lately; so much so that i had
begun to hate the sound of it ""we know something hastings "" he continued ""yes we know
something--and that is to the good--but we do not know nearly enough we must know more ""
""in what way ""
poirot settled himself back in his chair straightened a box of matches
which i had thrown carelessly down on the table and assumed an
attitude that i knew only too well i saw that he was prepared to hold
forth at some length ""see you hastings we have to contend against four adversaries; that
is against four different personalities with number one we have
never come into personal contact--we know him as it were only by
the impress of his mind--and in passing hastings i will tell you
that i begin to understand that mind very well--a mind most subtle and
oriental--every scheme and plot that we have encountered have emanated
from the brain of li chang yen number two and number three are so
powerful so high up that they are for the present immune from our
attacks nevertheless what is their safeguard is by a perverse chance our safeguard also they are so much in the limelight that their
movements must be carefully ordered and so we come to the last member
of the gang--we come to the man known as number four ""
poirot's voice altered a little as it always did when speaking of this
particular individual ""number two and number three are able to succeed to go on their
way unscathed owing to their notoriety and their assured position number four succeeds for the opposite reason--he succeeds by the way
of obscurity who is he nobody knows what does he look like again
nobody knows how many times have we seen him you and i five times is it not and could either of us say truthfully that we could be sure
of recognising him again ""
i was forced to shake my head as i ran back in my mind over those
five different people who incredible as it seemed were one and the
same man the burly lunatic asylum keeper the man in the buttoned up
overcoat in paris james the footman the quiet young medical man in
the yellow jasmine case and the russian professor in no way did any
two of these people resemble each other ""no "" i said hopelessly ""we've nothing to go by whatsoever ""
poirot smiled ""do not i pray of you give way to such enthusiastic despair we know
one or two things ""
""what kind of things "" i asked sceptically ""we know that he is a man of medium height and of medium or fair
colouring if he were a tall man of swarthy complexion he could never
have passed himself off as the fair stocky doctor it is child's play of course to put on an additional inch or so for the part of james or the professor in the same way he must have a short straight nose additions can be built on to a nose by skilful make up but a large
nose cannot be successfully reduced at a moment's notice then again he must be a fairly young man certainly not over thirty-five you see we are getting somewhere a man between thirty and thirty-five of
medium height and colouring an adept in the art of make up and with
very few or any teeth of his own ""
""what ""
""surely hastings as the keeper his teeth were broken and
discoloured in paris they were even and white as the doctor they
protruded slightly and as savaronoff they had unusually long canines nothing alters the face so completely as a different set of teeth you
see where all this is leading us ""
""not exactly "" i said cautiously ""a man carries his profession written in his face they say ""
""he's a criminal "" i cried ""he is an adept in the art of making up ""
""it's the same thing ""
""rather a sweeping statement hastings and one which would hardly be
appreciated by the theatrical world do you not see that the man is or
has been at one time or another an actor ""
""an actor ""
""but certainly he has the whole technique at his fingertips now there
are two classes of actors the one who sinks himself in his part and
the one who manages to impress his personality upon it it is from the
latter class that actor managers usually spring they seize a part and
mould it to their own personality the former class is quite likely
to spend its days doing mr lloyd george at different music halls or
impersonating old men with beards in repertory plays it is among that
former class that we must look for our number four he is a supreme
artist in the way he sinks himself in each part he plays ""
i was growing interested ""so you fancy you may be able to trace his identity through his
connection with the stage ""
""your reasoning is always brilliant hastings ""
""it might have been better "" i said coldly ""if the idea had come to
you sooner we have wasted a lot of time ""
""you are in error _mon ami_ no more time has been wasted
than was unavoidable for some months now my agents have been
engaged on the task joseph aarons is one of them you remember him they have compiled a list for me of men fulfilling the necessary
qualifications--young men round about the age of thirty of more or
less nondescript appearance and with a gift for playing character
parts--men moreover who have definitely left the stage within the
last three years ""
""well "" i said deeply interested ""the list was necessarily rather a long one for some time now we
have been engaged on the task of elimination and finally we have
boiled the whole thing down to four names here they are my friend ""
he tossed me over a sheet of paper i read its contents aloud ""ernest luttrell son of a north country parson always had a kink of
some kind in his moral make-up was expelled from his public school went on the stage at the age of twenty-three (there followed a list
of parts he had played with dates and places ) addicted to drugs supposed to have gone to australia four years ago cannot be traced

america played a few parts in new york did not appear on the stage
one night and has never been heard of since new york police say most
mysterious disappearance age about 33 hair brown fair complexion gray eyes height 5 ft 10-1/2 in ""most interesting "" i said as i laid down the paper ""and so this is
the result of the investigation of months these four names which of
them are you inclined to suspect ""
poirot made an eloquent gesture ""_mon ami_ for the moment it is an open question i would just
point out to you that claud darrell has been in china and america--a
fact not without significance perhaps but we must not allow ourselves
to be unduly biased by that point it may be a mere coincidence ""
""and the next step "" i asked eagerly ""affairs are already in train every day cautiously worded
advertisements will appear friends and relatives of one or the other
will be asked to communicate with my solicitor at his office even
to-day we might--aha the telephone probably it is as usual the
wrong number and they will regret to have troubled us but it may
be--yes it may be--that something has arisen ""
i crossed the room and picked up the receiver ""yes yes m poirot's rooms yes captain hastings speaking oh it's
you mr mcneil (mcneil and hodgson were poirot's solicitors ) i'll
tell him yes we'll come round at once ""
i replaced the receiver and turned to poirot my eyes dancing with
excitement ""i say poirot there's a woman there friend of claud darrell's miss
flossie monro mcneil wants you to come round ""
""at the instant "" cried poirot disappearing into his bedroom and
reappearing with a hat a taxi soon took us to our destination and we were ushered into mr mcneil's private office sitting in the arm-chair facing the solicitor
was a somewhat lurid looking lady no longer in her first youth her
hair was of an impossible yellow and was prolific in curls over each
ear her eyelids were heavily blackened and she had by no means
forgotten the rouge and the lip salve ""ah here is m poirot "" said mr mcneil ""m poirot this is
miss--er---monro who has very kindly called to give us some
information ""
""ah but that is most kind "" cried poirot he came forward with great empressement and shook the lady warmly by
the hand ""mademoiselle blooms like a flower in this dry-as-dust old office "" he
added careless of the feelings of mr mcneil this outrageous flattery was not without effect miss monro blushed and
simpered ""oh go on now mr poirot "" she exclaimed ""i know what you frenchmen
are like ""
""mademoiselle we are not mute like englishmen before beauty not that
i am a frenchman--i am a belgian you see ""
""i've been to ostend myself "" said miss monro the whole affair as poirot would have said was marching splendidly ""and so you can tell us something about mr claud darrell "" continued
poirot ""i knew mr darrell very well at one time "" explained the lady ""and
i saw your advertisement being out of a shop for the moment and my
time being my own i said to myself: there they want to know about
poor old claudie--lawyers too--maybe it's a fortune looking for the
rightful heir i'd better go round at once ""
mr mcneil rose ""well monsieur poirot shall i leave you for a little conversation
with miss monro ""
""you are too amiable but stay--a little idea presents itself to me the hour of the _dÃ©jeuner_ approaches mademoiselle will perhaps
honour me by coming out to luncheon with me ""
miss monro's eyes glistened it struck me that she was in exceedingly
low water and that the chance of a square meal was not to be despised a few minutes later saw us all in a taxi bound for one of london's
most expensive restaurants once arrived there poirot ordered a most
delectable lunch and then turned to his guest ""and for wine mademoiselle what do you say to champagne ""
miss monro said nothing--or everything the meal started pleasantly poirot replenished the lady's glass with
thoughtful assiduity and gradually slid on to the topic nearest his
heart ""the poor mr darrell what a pity he is not with us ""
""yes indeed "" sighed miss monro ""poor boy i do wonder what's become
of him ""
""it is a long time since you have seen him yes ""
""oh simply ages--not since the war he was a funny boy claudie very close about things never told you a word about himself but of
course that all fits in if he's a missing heir is it a title mr poirot ""
""alas a mere heritage "" said poirot unblushingly ""but you see it may
be a question of identification that is why it is necessary for us to
find some one who knew him very well indeed you knew him very well did you not mademoiselle ""
""i don't mind telling you mr poirot you're a gentleman you know
how to order a lunch for a lady--which is more than some of these
young whippersnappers do nowadays downright mean i call it as i
was saying you being a frenchman won't be shocked ah you frenchmen naughty naughty "" she wagged her finger at him in an excess of
archness ""well there it was me and claudie two young things--what
else could you expect and i've still a kindly feeling for him though mind you he didn't treat me well--no he didn't--he didn't treat me
well at all not as a lady should be treated they're all the same when
it comes to a question of money ""
""no no mademoiselle do not say that "" protested poirot filling up
her glass once more ""could you now describe this mr darrell to me ""
""he wasn't anything so very much to look at "" said flossie monro
dreamily ""neither tall nor short you know but quite well set up spruce looking eyes a sort of blue-gray and more or less fair-haired i suppose but oh what an artist _i_ never saw any one to touch
him in the profession he'd have made his name before now if it hadn't
been for jealousy ah mr poirot jealousy--you wouldn't believe it you really wouldn't what we artists have to suffer through jealousy why i remember once at manchester--""
we displayed what patience we could in listening to a long complicated
story about a pantomime and the infamous conduct of the principal boy then poirot led her gently back to the subject of claud darrell ""it is very interesting all this that you are able to tell
us mademoiselle about mr darrell women are such wonderful
observers--they see everything they notice the little detail that
escapes the mere man i have seen a woman identify one man out of a
dozen others--and why do you think she had observed that he had a
trick of stroking his nose when he was agitated now would a man ever
have thought of noticing a thing like that ""
""did you ever "" cried miss monro ""i suppose we do notice things i
remember claudie now i come to think of it always fiddling with his
bread at table he'd get a little piece between his fingers and then
dab it round to pick up crumbs i've seen him do it a hundred times why i'd know him anywhere by that one trick of his ""
""is not that just what i say the marvellous observation of a woman and did you ever speak to him about this little habit of his mademoiselle ""
""no i didn't mr poirot you know what men are they don't like you
to notice things especially if it should seem you were telling them off
about it i never said a word--but many's the time i smiled to myself bless you he never knew he was doing it even ""
poirot nodded gently i noticed that his own hand was shaking a little
as he stretched it out to his glass ""then there is always handwriting as a means of establishing identity ""
he remarked ""without doubt you have preserved a letter written by mr darrell ""
flossie monro shook her head regretfully ""he was never one for writing never wrote me a line in his life ""
""that is a pity "" said poirot ""i tell you what though "" said miss monro suddenly ""i've got a
photograph if that would be any good ""
""you have a photograph ""
poirot almost sprang from his seat with excitement ""it's quite an old one--eight years old at least ""
""_Ã§a ne fait rien _ no matter how old and faded ah _ma
foi_ but what stupendous luck you will permit me to inspect that
photograph mademoiselle ""
""why of course ""
""perhaps you will even permit me to have a copy made it would not take
long ""
""certainly if you like ""
miss monro rose ""well i must run away "" she declared archly ""very glad to have met
you and your friend mr poirot ""
""and the photograph when may i have it ""
""i'll look it out to-night i think i know where to lay my hand upon
it and i'll send it to you right away ""
""a thousand thanks mademoiselle you are all that is of the most
amiable i hope that we shall soon be able to arrange another little
lunch together ""
""as soon as you like "" said miss monro ""i'm willing ""
""let me see i do not think that i have your address ""
with a grand air miss monro drew a card from her hand-bag and handed
it to him it was a somewhat dirty card and the original address had
been scratched out and another substituted in pencil then with a good many bows and gesticulations on poirot's part we
bade farewell to the lady and got away ""do you really think this photograph so important "" i asked poirot ""yes _mon ami_ the camera does not lie one can magnify a
photograph seize salient points that otherwise would remain unnoticed and then there are a thousand details--such as the structure of the
ears which no one could ever describe to you in words oh yes it is
a great chance this which has come our way that is why i propose to
take precautions ""
he went across to the telephone as he finished speaking and gave a
number which i knew to be that of a private detective agency which he
sometimes employed his instructions were clear and definite two men
were to go to the address he gave and in general terms were to watch
over the safety of miss monro they were to follow her wherever she
went poirot hung up the receiver and came back to me ""do you really think that necessary poirot "" i asked ""it may be there is no doubt that we are watched you and i and since
that is so they will soon know with whom we were lunching to-day and
it is possible that number four will scent danger ""
about twenty minutes later the telephone bell rang i answered it a
curt voice spoke into the phone ""is that mr poirot st james hospital speaking a young woman was
brought in ten minutes ago street accident miss flossie monro she
is asking very urgently for mr poirot but he must come at once she
can't possibly last long ""
i repeated the words to poirot his face went white ""quick hastings we must go like the wind ""
a taxi took us to the hospital in less than ten minutes we asked for
miss monro and were taken immediately to the accident ward but a
white-capped sister met us in the doorway poirot read the news in her face ""it is over eh ""
""she died six minutes ago ""
poirot stood as though stunned the nurse mistaking his emotion began speaking gently ""she did not suffer and she was unconscious towards the last she was
run over by a motor you know--and the driver of the car did not even
stop wicked isn't it i hope some one took the number ""
""the stars fight against us "" said poirot in a low voice ""you would like to see her ""
the nurse led the way and we followed poor flossie monro with her rouge and her dyed hair she lay there
very peacefully with a little smile on her lips ""yes "" murmured poirot ""the stars fight against us--but is it the
stars "" he lifted his head as though struck by a sudden idea ""is it
the stars hastings if it is not--if it is not oh i swear to you my friend standing here by this poor woman's body that i will have no
mercy when the time comes ""
""what do you mean "" i asked but poirot had turned to the nurse and was eagerly demanding
information a list of the articles found in her hand-bag was finally
obtained poirot gave a suppressed cry as he read it over ""you see hastings you see ""
""see what ""
""there is no mention of a latch-key but she must have had a latch-key
with her no she was run down in cold blood and the first person who
bent over her took the key from her bag but we may yet be in time he
may not have been able to find at once what he sought ""
another taxi took us to the address flossie monro had given us a
squalid block of mansions in an unsavoury neighbourhood it was some
time before we could gain admission to miss monro's flat but we had at
least the satisfaction of knowing that no one could leave it whilst we
were on guard outside eventually we got in it was plain that some one had been before us the contents of drawers and cupboards were strewn all over the floor locks had been forced and small tables had even been overthrown so
violent had been the searcher's haste poirot began to hunt through the dÃ©bris suddenly he stood erect with
a cry holding out something it was an old fashioned photograph
frame--empty he turned it slowly over affixed to the back was a small round
label--a price label ""it cost four shillings "" i commented ""_mon dieu _ hastings use your eyes that is a new clean label it was stuck there by the man who took out the photograph the man who
was here before us but knew that we should come and so left this for
us--claud darrell--alias number four """
Chapter 15,"15 the terrible catastrophe
it was after the tragic death of miss flossie monro that i began to
be aware of a change in poirot up to now his invincible confidence
in himself had stood the test but it seemed as though at last the
long strain was beginning to tell his manner was grave and brooding and his nerves were on edge in these days he was as jumpy as a cat he avoided all discussion of the big four as far as possible and
seemed to throw himself into his ordinary work with almost his old
ardour nevertheless i knew that he was secretly active in the big
matter extraordinary-looking slavs were constantly calling to see
him and though he vouchsafed no explanation as to these mysterious
activities i realised that he was building some new defence or
weapon of opposition with the help of these somewhat repulsive-looking
foreigners once purely by chance i happened to see the entries in
his pass-book--he had asked me to verify some small item--and i noticed
the paying out of a huge sum--a huge sum even for poirot who was
coining money nowadays--to some russian with apparently every letter of
the alphabet in his name but he gave no clue as to the line on which he proposed to operate only over and over again he gave utterance to one phrase ""it is the
greatest mistake to underestimate your adversary remember that _mon
ami_ "" and i realised that that was the pitfall he was striving at
all costs to avoid so matters went on until the end of march and then one morning poirot
made a remark which startled me considerably ""this morning my friend i should recommend the best suit we go to
call upon the home secretary ""
""indeed that is very exciting he has called you in to take up a case ""
""not exactly the interview is of my seeking you may remember my
saying that i once did him some small service he is inclined to be
foolishly enthusiastic over my capabilities in consequence and i
am about to trade on this attitude of his as you know the french
premier m desjardeaux is over in london and at my request the home
secretary had arranged for him to be present at our little conference
this morning ""
the right honourable sydney crowther his majesty's secretary of state
for home affairs was a well-known and popular figure a man of some
fifty years of age with a quizzical expression and shrewd gray eyes he received us with that delightful bonhomie of manner which was well
known to be one of his principal assets standing with his back to the fireplace was a tall thin man with a
pointed black beard and a sensitive face ""m desjardeaux "" said crowther ""allow me to introduce to you m hercule poirot of whom you may perhaps already have heard ""
the frenchman bowed and shook hands ""i have indeed heard of m hercule poirot "" he said pleasantly ""who
has not ""
""you are too amiable monsieur "" said poirot bowing but his face
flushed with pleasure ""any word for an old friend "" asked a quiet voice and a man came
forward from a corner by a tall bookcase it was our old acquaintance mr ingles poirot shook him warmly by the hand ""and now m poirot "" said crowther ""we are at your service i
understood you to say that you had a communication of the utmost
importance to make to us ""
""that is so monsieur there is in the world to-day a vast
organisation--an organisation of crime it is controlled by four
individuals who are known and spoken of as the big four number one is
a chinaman li chang yen; number two is the american multi-millionaire abe ryland; number three is a frenchwoman; number four i have every
reason to believe is an obscure english actor called claud darrell these four are banded together to destroy the existing social order and to replace it with an anarchy in which they would reign as
dictators ""
""incredible "" muttered the frenchman ""ryland mixed up with a thing of
that kind surely the idea is too fantastic ""
""listen monsieur whilst i recount to you some of the doings of this
big four ""
it was an enthralling narrative which poirot unfolded familiar as i
was with all the details they thrilled me anew as i heard the bald
recital of our adventures and escapes m desjardeaux looked mutely at mr crowther as poirot finished the
other answered the look ""yes m desjardeaux i think we must admit the existence of a 'big
four ' scotland yard was inclined to jeer at first but they have been
forced to admit that m poirot was right in many of his claims the
only question is the extent of its aims i cannot but feel that m poirot--er--exaggerates a little ""
for answer poirot set forth ten salient points i have been asked not
to give them to the public even now and so i refrain from doing so but they included the extraordinary disasters to submarines which
occurred in a certain month and also a series of aeroplane accidents
and forced landings according to poirot these were all the work of
the big four and bore witness to the fact that they were in possession
of various scientific secrets unknown to the world at large this brought us straight to the question which i had been waiting for
the french premier to ask ""you say that the third member of this organisation is a frenchwoman have you any idea of her name ""
""it is a well-known name monsieur an honoured name number three is
no less than the famous madame olivier ""
at the mention of the world-famous scientist successor to the curies m desjardeaux positively bounded from his chair his face purple with
emotion ""madame olivier impossible absurd it is an insult what you say
there ""
poirot shook his head gently but made no answer desjardeaux looked at him in stupefaction for some moments then his
face cleared and he glanced at the home secretary and tapped his
forehead significantly ""m poirot is a great man "" he observed ""but even the great
man--sometimes he has his little mania does he not and seeks in high
places for fancied conspiracies it is well known you agree with me do you not mr crowther ""
the home secretary did not answer for some minutes then he spoke
slowly and heavily ""upon my soul i don't know "" he said at last ""i have always had and
still have the utmost belief in m poirot but--well this takes a bit
of believing ""
""this li chang yen too "" continued m desjardeaux ""who has ever heard
of him ""
""i have "" said the unexpected voice of mr ingles the frenchman stared at him and he stared placidly back again looking
more like a chinese idol than ever ""mr ingles "" explained the home
secretary ""is the greatest authority we have on the interior of china ""
""and you have heard of this li chang yen ""
""until m poirot here came to me i imagined that i was the only man
in england who had make no mistake m desjardeaux there is only one
man in china who counts to-day--li chang yen he has perhaps i only
say perhaps the finest brain in the world at the present time ""
m desjardeaux sat as though stunned presently however he rallied ""there may be something in what you say m poirot "" he said coldly ""but as regards madame olivier you are most certainly mistaken she is
a true daughter of france and devoted solely to the cause of science ""
poirot shrugged his shoulders and did not answer there was a minute or two's pause and then my little friend rose to
his feet with an air of dignity that sat rather oddly upon his quaint
personality ""that is all i have to say messieurs--to warn you i thought it
likely that i should not be believed but at least you will be on your
guard my words will sink in and each fresh event that comes along
will confirm your wavering faith it was necessary for me to speak
now--later i might not have been able to do so ""
""you mean-- "" asked crowther impressed in spite of himself by the
gravity of poirot's tone ""i mean monsieur that since i have penetrated the identity of number
four my life is not worth an hour's purchase he will seek to destroy
me at all costs--and not for nothing is he named 'the destroyer '
messieurs i salute you to you m crowther i deliver this key and
this sealed envelope i have got together all my notes on the case and my ideas as to how best to meet the menace that any day may break
upon the world and have placed them in a certain safe deposit in the
event of my death m crowther i authorise you to take charge of those
papers and make what use you can of them and now messieurs i wish
you good day ""
desjardeaux merely bowed coldly but crowther sprang up and held out
his hand ""you have converted me m poirot fantastic as the whole thing seems i believe utterly in the truth of what you have told us ""
ingles left at the same time as we did ""i am not disappointed with the interview "" said poirot as we walked
along ""i did not expect to convince desjardeaux but i have at least
ensured that if i die my knowledge does not die with me and i have
made one or two converts _pas si mal _""
""i'm with you as you know "" said ingles ""by the way i'm going out to
china as soon as i can get off ""
""is that wise ""
""no "" said ingles dryly ""but it's necessary one must do what one can ""
""ah you are a brave man "" cried poirot with emotion ""if we were not
in the street i would embrace you ""
i fancied that ingles looked rather relieved ""i don't suppose that i shall be in any more danger in china than you
are in london "" he growled ""that is possibly true enough "" admitted poirot ""i hope that they will
not succeed in massacring hastings also that is all that would annoy
me greatly ""
i interrupted this cheerful conversation to remark that i had no
intention of letting myself be massacred and shortly afterwards ingles
parted from us for some time we went along in silence which poirot at length broke by
uttering a totally unexpected remark ""i think--i really think--that i shall have to bring my brother into
this ""
""your brother "" i cried astonished ""i never knew you had a brother ""
""you surprise me hastings do you not know that all celebrated
detectives have brothers who would be even more celebrated then they
are were it not for constitutional indolence ""
poirot employs a peculiar manner sometimes which makes it wellnigh
impossible to know whether he is jesting or in earnest that manner was
very evident at the moment ""what is your brother's name "" i asked trying to adjust myself to this
new idea ""achille poirot "" replied poirot gravely ""he lives near spa in
belgium ""
""what does he do "" i asked with some curiosity putting aside a
half-formed wonder as to the character and disposition of the late
madame poirot and her classical taste in christian names ""he does nothing he is as i tell of a singularly indolent
disposition but his abilities are hardly less than my own--which is
saying a great deal ""
""is he like you to look at ""
""not unlike but not nearly so handsome and he wears no moustaches ""
""is he older than you or younger ""
""he happens to have been born on the same day ""
""a twin "" i cried ""exactly hastings you jump to the right conclusion with unfailing
accuracy but here we are at home again let us at once get to work on
that little affair of the duchess's necklace ""
but the duchess's necklace was doomed to wait awhile a case of quite
another description was waiting for us our landlady mrs pearson at once informed us that a hospital nurse
had called and was waiting to see poirot we found her sitting in the big arm-chair facing the window a
pleasant-faced woman of middle age in a dark blue uniform she was a
little reluctant to come to the point but poirot soon put her at her
ease and she embarked upon her story ""you see m poirot i've never come across anything of the kind
before i was sent for from the lark sisterhood to go down to a case
in hertfordshire an old gentleman it is mr templeton quite a
pleasant house and quite pleasant people the wife mrs templeton is
much younger than her husband and he has a son by his first marriage
who lives there i don't know that the young man and the step-mother
always get on together he's not quite what you'd call normal--not
'wanting' exactly but decidedly dull in the intellect well this
illness of mr templeton's seemed to me from the first to be very
mysterious at times there seemed really nothing the matter with him and then he suddenly has one of these gastric attacks with pain and
vomiting but the doctor seemed quite satisfied and it wasn't for me
to say anything but i couldn't help thinking about it and then--""
she paused and became rather red ""something happened which aroused your suspicions "" suggested poirot ""yes ""
but she still seemed to find it difficult to go on ""i found the servants were passing remarks too ""
""about mr templeton's illness ""
""oh no about--about this other thing--""
""mrs templeton ""
""yes ""
""mrs templeton and the doctor perhaps ""
poirot had an uncanny flair in these things the nurse threw him a
grateful glance and went on ""they _were_ passing remarks and then one day i happened to see
them together myself--in the garden--""
it was left at that our client was in such an agony of outraged
propriety that no one could feel it necessary to ask exactly what she
had seen in the garden she had evidently seen quite enough to make up
her own mind on the situation ""the attacks got worse and worse dr treves said it was all perfectly
natural and to be expected and that mr templeton could not possibly
live long but i've never seen anything like it before myself--not in
all my long experience of nursing it seemed to me much more like some
form of--""
she paused hesitating ""arsenical poisoning "" said poirot helpfully she nodded ""and then too he the patient i mean said something queer 'they'll
do for me the four of them they'll do for me yet '""
""eh "" said poirot quickly ""those were his very words m poirot he was in great pain at the
time of course and hardly knew what he was saying ""
""'they'll do for me the four of them '"" repeated poirot thoughtfully ""what did he mean by 'the four of them ' do you think ""
""that i can't say m poirot i thought perhaps he meant his wife
and son and the doctor and perhaps miss clark mrs templeton's
companion that would make four wouldn't it he might think they were
all in league against him ""
""quite so quite so "" said poirot in a preoccupied voice ""what about
food could you take no precautions about that ""
""i'm always doing what i can but of course sometimes mrs templeton
insists on bringing him his food herself and then there are the times
when i am off duty ""
""exactly and you are not sure enough of your ground to go to the
police ""
the nurse's face showed her horror at the mere idea ""what i have done m poirot is this mr templeton had a very bad
attack after partaking of a bowl of soup i took a little from the
bottom of the bowl afterwards and have brought it up with me i have
been spared for the day to visit a sick mother as mr templeton was
well enough to be left ""
she drew out a little bottle of dark fluid and handed it to poirot ""excellent mademoiselle we will have this analysed immediately if
you will return here in say an hour's time i think that we shall be
able to dispose of your suspicions one way or another ""
first extracting from our visitor her name and qualifications he
ushered her out then he wrote a note and sent it off together with
the bottle of soup whilst we waited to hear the result poirot amused
himself by verifying the nurse's credentials somewhat to my surprise ""no no my friend "" he declared ""i do well to be careful do not
forget the big four are on our track ""
however he soon elicited the information that a nurse of the name of
mabel palmer was a member of the lark institute and had been sent to
the case in question ""so far so good "" he said with a twinkle ""and now here comes nurse
palmer back again and here also is our analyst's report ""
both the nurse and i waited anxiously whilst poirot read the analyst's
report ""is there arsenic in it "" she asked breathlessly poirot shook his head refolding the paper ""no ""
we were both immeasurably surprised ""there is no arsenic in it "" continued poirot ""but there is antimony and that being the case we will start immediately for hertfordshire pray heaven that we are not too late ""
it was decided that the simplest plan was for poirot to represent
himself truly as a detective but that the ostensible reason of his
visit should be to question mrs templeton about a servant formerly in
her employment whose name he obtained from nurse palmer and who he
could represent as being concerned in a jewel robbery it was late when we arrived at elmstead as the house was called we
had allowed nurse palmer to precede us by about twenty minutes so that
there should be no question of our all arriving together mrs templeton a tall dark woman with sinuous movements and uneasy
eyes received us i noticed that as poirot announced his profession she drew in her breath with a sudden hiss as though badly startled but she answered his question about the maid-servant readily enough and then to test her poirot embarked upon a long history of a
poisoning case in which a guilty wife had figured his eyes never left
her face as he talked and try as she would she could hardly conceal
her rising agitation suddenly with an incoherent word of excuse she
hurried from the room we were not long left alone a squarely-built man with a small red
moustache and pince-nez came in ""dr treves "" he introduced himself ""mrs templeton asked me to make
her excuses to you she's in a very bad state you know nervous
strain worry over her husband and all that i've prescribed bed and
bromide but she hopes you'll stay and take pot luck and i'm to do
host we've heard of you down here m poirot and we mean to make the
most of you ah here's micky ""
a shambling young man entered the room he had a very round face and
foolish-looking eyebrows raised as though in perpetual surprise he
grinned awkwardly as he shook hands this was clearly the ""wanting""
son presently we all went in to dinner dr treves left the room--to open
some wine i think---and suddenly the boy's physiognomy underwent a
startling change he leant forward staring at poirot ""you've come about father "" he said nodding his head ""_i_ know i know lots of things--but nobody thinks i do mother will be glad when
father's dead and she can marry dr treves she isn't my own mother you know i don't like her she wants father to die ""
it was all rather horrible luckily before poirot had time to reply the doctor came back and we had to carry on a forced conversation and then suddenly poirot lay back in his chair with a hollow groan his
face was contorted with pain ""my dear sir what's the matter "" cried the doctor ""a sudden spasm i am used to them no no i require no assistance
from you doctor if i might lie down upstairs ""
his request was instantly acceded to and i accompanied him upstairs where he collapsed on the bed groaning heavily for the first minute or two i had been taken in but i had quickly
realised that poirot was--as he would have put it--playing the comedy and that his object was to be left alone upstairs near the patient's
room hence i was quite prepared when the instant we were alone he sprang
up ""quick hastings the window there is ivy outside we can climb down
before they begin to suspect ""
""climb down ""
""yes we must get out of this house at once you saw him at dinner ""
""the doctor ""
""no young templeton his trick with his bread do you remember what
flossie monro told us before she died that claud darrell had a
habit of dabbing his bread on the table to pick up crumbs hastings this is a vast plot and that vacant-looking young man is our arch
enemy--number four hurry ""
i did not wait to argue incredible as the whole thing seemed it was
wiser not to delay we scrambled down the ivy as quietly as we could
and made a bee-line for the small town and the railway station we were
just able to catch the last train the 8 34 which would land us in town
about eleven o'clock ""a plot "" said poirot thoughtfully ""how many of them were in it i
wonder i suspect that the whole templeton family are just so many
agents of the big four did they simply want to decoy us down there or
was it more subtle than that did they intend to play the comedy down
there and keep me interested until they had had time to do--what i
wonder now ""
he remained very thoughtful arrived at our lodgings he restrained me at the door of the
sitting-room ""attention hastings i have my suspicions let me enter first ""
he did so and to my slight amusement took the precaution to press
on the electric switch with an old galosh then he went round the room
like a strange cat cautiously delicately on the alert for danger i
watched him for some time remaining obediently where i had been put by
the wall ""it's all right poirot "" i said impatiently ""it seems so _mon ami_ it seems so but let us make sure ""
""rot "" i said ""i shall light the fire anyway and have a pipe i've
caught you out for once you had the matches last and you didn't put
them back in the holder as usual--the very thing you're always cursing
me for doing ""
i stretched out my hand i heard poirot's warning cry--saw him leaping
towards me--my hand touched the match-box then--a flash of blue flame--an ear-rending crash--and darkness--
i came to myself to find the familiar face of our old friend dr ridgeway bending over me an expression of relief passed over his
features ""keep still "" he said soothingly ""you're all right there's been an
accident you know ""
""poirot "" i murmured ""you're in my digs everything's quite all right ""
a cold fear clutched at my heart his evasion woke a horrible fear ""poirot "" i reiterated ""what of poirot ""
he saw that i had to know and that further evasions were useless ""by a miracle you escaped--poirot--did not ""
a cry burst from my lips ""not dead not dead ""
ridgeway bowed his head his features working with emotion with desperate energy i pulled myself to a sitting position ""poirot may be dead "" i said weakly ""but his spirit lives on i will
carry on his work death to the big four ""
then i fell back fainting "
Chapter 16,"16 the dying chinaman
even now i can hardly bear to write of those days in march poirot--the unique the inimitable hercule poirot--dead there was a
particularly diabolical touch in the disarranged match-box which was
certain to catch his eye and which he would hasten to rearrange--and
thereby touch off the explosion that as a matter of fact it was i
who actually precipitated the catastrophe never ceased to fill me with
unavailing remorse it was as doctor ridgeway said a perfect miracle
that i had not been killed but had escaped with a slight concussion although it had seemed to me as though i regained consciousness almost
immediately it was in reality over twenty-four hours before i came
back to life it was not until the evening of the day following that i
was able to stagger feebly into an adjoining room and view with deep
emotion the plain elm coffin which held the remains of one of the most
marvellous men this world has ever known from the very first moment of regaining consciousness i had only one
purpose in mind--to avenge poirot's death and to hunt down the big
four remorselessly i had thought that ridgeway would have been of one mind with me about
this but to my surprise the good doctor seemed unaccountably lukewarm ""get back to south america"" was his advice tendered on every occasion why attempt the impossible put as delicately as possible his opinion
amounted to this:--if poirot the unique poirot had failed was it
likely that i should succeed but i was obstinate putting aside any question as to whether i had the
necessary qualifications for the task (and i may say in passing that
i did not entirely agree with his views on this point) i had worked
so long with poirot that i knew his methods by heart and felt fully
capable of taking up the work where he had laid it down; it was with
me a question of feeling my friend had been foully murdered was
i to go tamely back to south america without an effort to bring his
murderers to justice i said all this and more to ridgeway who listened attentively enough ""all the same "" he said when i had finished ""my advice does not vary i am earnestly convinced that poirot himself if he were here would
urge you to return in his name i beg of you hastings abandon these
wild ideas and go back to your ranch ""
to that only one answer was possible and shaking his head sadly he
said no more it was a month before i was fully restored to health towards the end
of april i sought and obtained an interview with the home secretary mr crowther's manner was reminiscent of that of dr ridgeway it was
soothing and negative whilst appreciating the offer of my services he gently and considerately declined them the papers referred to by
poirot had passed into his keeping and he assured me that all possible
steps were being taken to deal with the approaching menace with that cold comfort i was forced to be satisfied mr crowther ended
the interview by urging me to return to south america i found the
whole thing profoundly unsatisfactory i should i suppose in its proper place have described poirot's
funeral it was a solemn and moving ceremony and the extraordinary
number of floral tributes passed belief they came from high and low
alike and bore striking testimony to the place my friend had made
for himself in the country of his adoption for myself i was frankly
overcome by emotion as i stood by the grave side and thought of all our
varied experiences and the happy days we had passed together by the beginning of may i had mapped out a plan of campaign i felt
that i could not do better than keep poirot's scheme of advertising
for any information respecting claud darrell i had an advertisement
to this effect inserted in a number of morning newspapers and i was
sitting in a small restaurant in soho and judging of the effect of the
advertisement when a small paragraph in another part of the paper gave
me a nasty shock very briefly it reported the mysterious disappearance of mr john
ingles from the _s s shanghai_ shortly after the latter had
left marseilles although the weather was perfectly smooth it was
feared that the unfortunate gentleman must have fallen overboard the paragraph ended with a brief reference to mr ingles's long and
distinguished service in china the news was unpleasant i read into ingles's death a sinister motive not for one moment did i believe the theory of an accident ingles had
been murdered and his death was only too clearly the handiwork of that
accursed big four as i sat there stunned by the blow and turning the whole matter over
in my mind i was startled by the remarkable behaviour of the man
sitting opposite me so far i had not paid much attention to him he
was a thin dark man of middle age sallow of complexion with a small
pointed beard he had sat down opposite me so quietly that i had hardly
noticed his arrival but his actions now were decidedly peculiar to say the least of them leaning forward he deliberately helped me to salt putting it in four
little heaps round the edge of my plate ""you will excuse me "" he said in a melancholy voice ""to help a
stranger to salt is to help them to sorrow they say that may be an
unavoidable necessity i hope not though i hope that you will be
reasonable ""
then with a certain significance he repeated his operations with
the salt on his own plate the symbol 4 was too plain to be missed i
looked at him searchingly in no way that i could see did he resemble
young templeton or james the footman or any other of the various
personalities we had come across nevertheless i was convinced
that i had to do with no less than the redoubtable number four
himself in his voice there was certainly a faint resemblance to the
buttoned-up-stranger who had called upon us in paris i looked round undecided as to my course of action reading my
thoughts he smiled and gently shook his head ""i should not advise it "" he remarked ""remember what came of your
hasty action in paris let me assure you that my way of retreat is
well assured your ideas are inclined to be a little crude captain
hastings if i may say so ""
""you devil "" i said choking with rage ""you incarnate devil ""
""heated--just a trifle heated your late lamented friend would have
told you that a man who keeps calm has always a great advantage ""
""you dare to speak of him "" i cried ""the man you murdered so foully and you come here--""
he interrupted me ""i came here for an excellent and peaceful purpose to advise you to
return at once to south america if you do so that is the end of the
matter as far as the big four are concerned you and yours will not be
molested in any way i give you my word as to that ""
i laughed scornfully ""and if i refuse to obey your autocratic command ""
""it is hardly a command shall we say that it is--a warning ""
there was a cold menace in his tone ""the first warning "" he said softly ""you will be well advised not to
disregard it ""
then before i had any hint of his intention he rose and slipped
quickly away towards the door i sprang to my feet and was after him
in a second but by bad luck i cannoned straight into an enormously
fat man who blocked the way between me and the next table by the time
i had disentangled myself my quarry was just passing through the
doorway and the next delay was from a waiter carrying a huge pile of
plates who crashed into me without the least warning by the time i got
to the door there was no sign of the thin man with the dark beard the waiter was fulsome in apologies the fat man was sitting placidly
at a table ordering his lunch there was nothing to show that both
occurrences had not been a pure accident nevertheless i had my own
opinion as to that i knew well enough that the agents of the big four
were everywhere needless to say i paid no heed to the warning given me i would do
or die in the good cause i received in all only two answers to the
advertisements neither of them gave me any information of value they
were both from actors who had played with claud darrell at one time or
another neither of them knew him at all intimately and no new light
was thrown upon the problem of his identity and present whereabouts no further sign came from the big four until about ten days later i
was crossing hyde park lost in thought when a voice rich with a
persuasive foreign inflection hailed me ""captain hastings is it not ""
a big limousine had just drawn up by the pavement a woman was leaning
out exquisitely dressed in black with wonderful pearls i recognised
the lady first known to us as countess vera rossakoff and afterwards
under a different alias as an agent of the big four poirot for some
reason or other had always had a sneaking fondness for the countess something in her very flamboyance attracted the little man she was he
was wont to declare in moments of enthusiasm a woman in a thousand that she was arrayed against us on the side of our bitterest enemies never seemed to weigh in his judgment ""ah do not pass on "" said the
countess ""i have something most important to say to you and do not
try to have me arrested either for that would be stupid you were
always a little stupid--yes yes it is so you are stupid now when
you persist in disregarding the warning we sent you it is the second
warning i bring you leave england at once you can do no good here--i
tell you that frankly you will never accomplish anything ""
""in that case "" i said stiffly ""it seems rather extraordinary that you
are all so anxious to get me out of the country ""
the countess shrugged her shoulders--magnificent shoulders and a
magnificent gesture ""for my part i think that too stupid i would leave you here to play
about happily but the chiefs you see are fearful that some word of
yours may give great help to those more intelligent than yourself hence--you are to be banished ""
the countess appeared to have a flattering idea of my abilities i
concealed my annoyance doubtless this attitude of hers was assumed
expressly to annoy me and to give me the idea that i was unimportant ""it would of course be quite easy to--remove you "" she continued ""but i am quite sentimental sometimes i pleaded for you you have a
nice little wife somewhere have you not and it would please the poor
little man who is dead to know that you were not to be killed i always
liked him you know he was clever--but clever had it not been a case
of four against one i honestly believe he might have been too much for
us i confess it frankly--he was my master i sent a wreath to the
funeral as a token of my admiration--an enormous one of crimson roses crimson roses express my temperament ""
i listened in silence and a growing distaste ""you have the look of a mule when it puts its ears back and kicks well i have delivered my warning remember this the third warning
will come by the hand of the destroyer--""
she made a sign and the car whirled away rapidly i noted the number
mechanically but without the hope that it would lead to anything the
big four were not apt to be careless in details i went home a little sobered one fact had emerged from the countess's
flood of volubility i was in real danger of my life though i had no
intention of abandoning the struggle i saw that it behoved me to walk
warily and adopt every possible precaution whilst i was reviewing all these facts and seeking for the best line of
action the telephone bell rang i crossed the room and picked up the
receiver ""yes hallo who's speaking ""
a crisp voice answered me ""this is st giles' hospital we have a chinaman here knifed in the
street and brought in he can't last long we rang you up because we
found in his pocket a piece of paper with your name and address on it ""
i was very much astonished nevertheless after a moment's reflection i
said that i would come down at once st giles' hospital was i knew down by the docks and it occurred to me that the chinaman might have
just come off some ship it was on my way down there that a sudden suspicion shot into my mind was the whole thing a trap wherever a chinaman was there might be the
hand of li chang yen i remembered the adventure of the baited trap was the whole thing a ruse on the part of my enemies a little reflection convinced me that at any rate a visit to the
hospital would do no harm it was probable that the thing was not so
much a plot as what is vulgarly known as a ""plant "" the dying chinaman
would make some revelation to me upon which i should act and which
would have the result of leading me into the hands of the big four the
thing to do was to preserve an open mind and whilst feigning credulity
be secretly on my guard on arriving at st giles' hospital and making my business known i
was taken at once to the accident ward to the bedside of the man in
question he lay absolutely still his eyelids closed and only a very
faint movement of the chest showed that he still breathed a doctor
stood by the bed his fingers on the chinaman's pulse ""he's almost gone "" he whispered to me ""you know him eh ""
i shook my head ""i've never seen him before ""
""then what was he doing with your name and address in his pocket you
are captain hastings aren't you ""
""yes but i can't explain it any more than you can ""
""curious thing from his papers he seems to have been the servant of a
man called ingles--a retired civil servant ah you know him do you ""
he added quickly as i started at the name ingles's servant then i _had_ seen him before not that i had
ever succeeded in being able to distinguish one chinaman from another he must have been with ingles on his way to china and after the
catastrophe he had returned to england with a message possibly for
me it was vital imperative that i should hear that message ""is he conscious "" i asked ""can he speak mr ingles was an old friend
of mine and i think it possible that this poor fellow has brought me a
message from him mr ingles is believed to have gone overboard about
ten days ago ""
""he's just conscious but i doubt if he has the force to speak he lost
a terrible lot of blood you know i can administer a stimulant of
course but we've already done all that is possible in that direction ""
nevertheless he administered a hypodermic injection and i stayed by
the bed hoping against hope for a word--a sign--that might be of the
utmost value to me in my work but the minutes sped on and no sign
came and suddenly a baleful idea shot across my mind was i not already
falling into the trap suppose that this chinaman had merely assumed
the part of ingles's servant that he was in reality an agent of the
big four had i not once read that certain chinese priests were capable
of simulating death or to go further still li chang yen might
command a little band of fanatics who would welcome death itself if it
came at the command of their master i must be on my guard even as these thoughts flashed across my mind the man in the bed
stirred his eyes opened he murmured something incoherently then i
saw his glance fasten upon me he made no sign of recognition but i
was at once aware that he was trying to speak to me be he friend or
foe i must hear what he had to say i leaned over the bed but the broken sounds conveyed no sort of
meaning to me i thought i caught the word ""hand "" but in what
connection it was used i could not tell then it came again and this
time i heard another word the word ""largo "" i stared in amazement as
the possible juxtaposition of the two suggested itself to me ""handel's largo "" i queried the chinaman's eyelids flickered rapidly as though in assent and he
added another italian word the word ""_carrozza_ "" two or three
more words of murmured italian came to my ears and then he fell back
abruptly the doctor pushed me aside it was all over the man was dead i went out into the air again thoroughly bewildered ""handel's largo "" and a ""_carrozza_ "" if i remembered rightly a
_carrozza_ was a carriage what possible meaning could lie behind
those simple words the man was a chinaman not an italian why should
he speak in italian surely if he were indeed ingles's servant he
must know english the whole thing was profoundly mystifying i puzzled
over it all the way home oh if only poirot had been there to solve
the problem with his lightning ingenuity i let myself in with my latch-key and went slowly up to my room a
letter was lying on the table and i tore it open carelessly enough but in a minute i stood rooted to the ground whilst i read it was a communication from a firm of solicitors ""dear sir (it ran) --as instructed by our late client m hercule poirot we forward you the enclosed letter this letter was
 placed in our hands a week before his death with instructions that
 in the event of his demise it should be sent to you at a certain
 date after his death ""yours faithfully etc ""
i turned the enclosed missive over and over it was undoubtedly from
poirot i knew that familiar writing only too well with a heavy heart yet a certain eagerness i tore it open ""mon cher ami (it began) --when you receive this i shall be
 no more do not shed tears about me but follow my orders immediately upon receipt of this return to south america do
 not be pig-headed about this it is not for sentimental reasons
 that i bid you undertake the journey _it is necessary _ it is
 part of the plan of hercule poirot to say more is unnecessary to any one who has the acute intelligence of my friend hastings ""_a bas_ the big four i salute you my friend from beyond the
 grave ""ever thine ""hercule poirot ""
i read and re-read this astonishing communication one thing was
evident this amazing man had so provided for every eventuality that
even his own death did not upset the sequence of his plans mine was
to be the active part--his the directing genius doubtless i should
find full instructions awaiting me beyond the seas in the meantime my
enemies convinced that i was obeying their warning would cease to
trouble their heads about me i could return unsuspected and work
havoc in their midst there was now nothing to hinder my immediate departure i sent off
cables booked my passage and one week later found me embarking in
the _ansonia_ en route for buenos ayres just as the boat left the quay a steward brought me a note it had
been given him so he explained by a big gentleman in a fur coat who
had left the boat last thing before the gangway planks were lifted i opened it it was terse and to the point ""you are wise "" it ran it was signed with a big figure 4 i could afford to smile to myself the sea was not too choppy i enjoyed a passable dinner made up my
mind as to the majority of my fellow passengers and had a rubber or
two of bridge then i turned in and slept like a log as i always do on
board ship i was awakened by feeling myself persistently shaken dazed and
bewildered i saw that one of the ship's officers was standing over me he gave a sigh of relief as i sat up ""thank the lord i've got you awake at last i've had no end of a job do you always sleep like that ""
""what's the matter "" i asked still bewildered and not fully awake ""is
there anything wrong with the ship ""
""i expect you know what's the matter better than i do "" he replied
dryly ""special instructions from the admiralty there's a destroyer
waiting to take you off ""
""what "" i cried ""in mid-ocean ""
""it seems a most mysterious affair but that's not my business they've
sent a young fellow aboard who is to take your place and we are all
sworn to secrecy will you get up and dress ""
utterly unable to conceal my amazement i did as i was told a boat
was lowered and i was conveyed aboard the destroyer there i was
received courteously but got no further information the commander's
instructions were to land me at a certain spot on the belgian coast there his knowledge and responsibility ended the whole thing was like a dream the one idea i held to firmly was
that all this must be part of poirot's plan i must simply go forward
blindly trusting in my dead friend i was duly landed at the spot indicated there a motor was waiting and soon i was rapidly whirling along across the flat flemish plains i slept that night at a small hotel in brussels the next day we went
on again the country became wooded and hilly i realised that we were
penetrating into the ardennes and i suddenly remembered poirot's
saying that he had a brother who lived at spa but we did not go to spa itself we left the main road and wound into
the leafy fastnesses of the hills till we reached a little hamlet and
an isolated white villa high on the hill-side here the car stopped in
front of the green door of the villa the door opened as i alighted an elderly man-servant stood in the
doorway bowing ""m le capitaine hastings "" he said in french ""monsieur le capitaine
is expected if he will follow me ""
he led the way across the hall and flung open a door at the back standing aside to let me pass in i blinked a little for the room faced west and the afternoon sun
was pouring in then my vision cleared and i saw a figure waiting to
welcome me with outstretched hands it was--oh impossible it couldn't be--but yes ""poirot "" i cried and for once did not attempt to evade the embrace
with which he overwhelmed me ""but yes but yes it is indeed i not so easy to kill hercule poirot ""
""but poirot--_why_ ""
""a _ruse de guerre_ my friend a _ruse de guerre_ all is
now ready for our grand coup ""
""but you might have told _me_ ""
""no hastings i could not never never in a thousand years could
you have acted the part at the funeral as it was it was perfect it
could not fail to carry conviction to the big four ""
""but what i've been through--""
""do not think me too unfeeling i carried out the deception partly for
your sake i was willing to risk my own life but i had qualms about
continually risking yours so after the explosion i have an idea of
great brilliancy the good ridgeway he enables me to carry it out i
am dead you will return to south america but _mon ami_ that is
just what you would not do in the end i have to arrange a solicitor's
letter and a long rigmarole but at all events here you are--that
is the great thing and now we lie here--_perdu_--till the moment
comes for the last grand coup--the final overthrowing of the big four """
Chapter 17,"17 number four wins a trick
from our quiet retreat in the ardennes we watched the progress
of affairs in the great world we were plentifully supplied with
newspapers and every day poirot received a bulky envelope evidently
containing some kind of report he never showed these reports to me but i could usually tell from his manner whether its contents had been
satisfactory or otherwise he never wavered in his belief that our
present plan was the only one likely to be crowned by success ""as a minor point hastings "" he remarked one day ""i was in continual
fear of your death lying at my door and that rendered me nervous--like
a cat upon the jumps as you say but now i am well satisfied even if
they discover that the captain hastings who landed in south america is
an imposter (and i do not think they will discover it they are not
likely to send an agent out there who knows you personally) they will
only believe that you are trying to circumvent them in some clever
manner of your own and will pay no serious attention to discovering
your whereabouts of the one vital fact my supposed death they are
thoroughly convinced they will go ahead and mature their plans ""
""and then "" i asked eagerly ""and then _mon ami_ grand resurrection of hercule poirot at the
eleventh hour i reappear throw all into confusion and achieve the
supreme victory in my own unique manner ""
i realised that poirot's vanity was of the case-hardened variety which
could withstand all attacks i reminded him that once or twice the
honours of the game had lain with our adversaries but i might have
known that it was impossible to diminish hercule poirot's enthusiasm
for his own methods ""see you hastings it is like the little trick that you play with the
cards you have seen it without doubt you take the four knaves you
divide them one on top of the pack one underneath and so on--you
cut and you shuffle and there they are all together again that is my
object so far i have been contending now against one of the big four now against another but let me get them all together like the four
knaves in the pack of cards and then with one coup i destroy them
all ""
""and how do you propose to get them all together "" i asked ""by awaiting the supreme moment by lying _perdu_ until they are
ready to strike ""
""that may mean a long wait "" i grumbled ""always impatient the good hastings but no it will not be so long the one man they were afraid of--myself--is out of the way i give them
two or three months at most ""
his speaking of some one being got out of the way reminded me of ingles
and his tragic death and i remembered that i had never told poirot
about the dying chinaman in st giles' hospital he listened with keen attention to my story ""ingles's servant eh and the few words he uttered were in italian curious ""
""that's why i suspected it might have been a plant on the part of the
big four ""
""your reasoning is at fault hastings employ the little gray cells if
your enemies wished to deceive you they would assuredly have seen to it
that the chinaman spoke in intelligible pigeon english no the message
was genuine tell me again all that you heard ""
""first of all he made a reference to handel's largo and then he said
something that sounded like '_carrozzo_'--that's a carriage isn't
it ""
""nothing else ""
""well just at the end he murmured something like 'cara' somebody or
other--some woman's name zia i think but i don't suppose that that
had any bearing on the rest of it ""
""you would not suppose so hastings cara zia is very important very
important indeed ""
""i don't see--""
""my dear friend you _never_ see--and anyway the english know no
geography ""
""geography "" i cried ""what has geography got to do with it ""
""i dare say m thomas cook would be more to the point ""
as usual poirot refused to say anything more--a most irritating trick
of his but i noticed that his manner became extremely cheerful as
though he had scored some point or other the days went on pleasant if a trifle monotonous there were plenty
of books in the villa and delightful rambles all around but i chafed
sometimes at the forced inactivity of our life and marvelled at
poirot's state of placid content nothing occurred to ruffle our quiet
existence and it was not until the end of june well within the limit
that poirot had given them that we had our news of the big four a car drove up to the villa early one morning such an unusual event in
our peaceful life that i hurried down to satisfy my curiosity i found
poirot talking to a pleasant-faced young fellow of about my own age he introduced me ""this is captain harvey hastings one of the most famous members of
your intelligence service ""
""not famous at all i'm afraid "" said the young man laughing
pleasantly ""not famous except to those in the know i should have said most of
captain harvey's friends and acquaintances consider him an amiable but
brainless young man--devoted only to the trot of the fox or whatever
the dance is called ""
we both laughed ""well well to business "" said poirot ""you are of opinion the time
has come then ""
""we are sure of it sir china was isolated politically yesterday what
is going on out there nobody knows no news of any kind wireless or
otherwise has come through--just a complete break--and silence ""
""li chang yen has shown his hand and the others ""
""abe ryland arrived in england a week ago and left for the continent
yesterday ""
""and madame olivier ""
""madame olivier left paris last night ""
""for italy ""
""for italy sir as far as we can judge they are both making for the
resort you indicated--though how you knew that--""
""ah that is not the cap with the feather for me that was the work of
hastings here he conceals his intelligence you comprehend but it is
profound for all that ""
harvey looked at me with due appreciation and i felt rather
uncomfortable ""all is in train then "" said poirot he was pale now and completely
serious ""the time has come the arrangements are all made ""
""everything you ordered has been carried out the governments of italy france and england are behind you and are all working harmoniously
together ""
""it is in fact a new entente "" observed poirot dryly ""i am glad
that desjardeaux is convinced at last _eh bien_ then we will
start--or rather i will start you hastings will remain here--yes i
pray of you in verity my friend i am serious ""
i believed him but it was not likely that i should consent to being
left behind in that fashion our argument was short but decisive it was not until we were in the train speeding towards paris that he
admitted that he was secretly glad of my decision ""for you have a part to play hastings an important part without you i might well fail nevertheless i felt that it was my duty to urge
you to remain behind ""
""there is danger then ""
""_mon ami_ where there is the big four there is always danger ""
on arrival in paris we drove across to the gare de l'est and poirot
at last announced our destination we were bound for bolzano and
italian tyrol during harvey's absence from our carriage i took the opportunity of
asking poirot why he had said that the discovery of the rendezvous was
my work ""because it was my friend how ingles managed to get hold of the
information i do not know but he did and he sent it to us by his
servant we are bound _mon ami_ for karersee the new italian
name for which is lago di carezza you see now where your 'cara zia'
comes in and also your 'carrozza' and 'largo'--the handel was supplied
by your own imagination possibly some reference to the information
coming from the 'hand' of m ingles started the train of association ""
""karersee "" i queried ""i never heard of it ""
""i always tell you that the english know no geography but as a matter
of fact it is a well-known and very beautiful summer resort four
thousand feet up in the heart of the dolomites ""
""and it is in this out of the way spot that the big four have their
rendezvous ""
""say rather their headquarters the signal has been given and it is
their intention to disappear from the world and issue orders from their
mountain fastness i have made the inquiries--a lot of quarrying of
stone and mineral deposits is done there and the company apparently
a small italian firm is in reality controlled by abe ryland i am
prepared to swear that a vast subterranean dwelling has been hollowed
out in the very heart of the mountain secret and inaccessible from
there the leaders of the organisation will issue by wireless their
orders to their followers who are numbered by thousands in every
country and from that crag in the dolomites the dictators of the world
will emerge that is to say--they would emerge were it not for hercule
poirot ""
""do you seriously believe all this poirot what about the armies and
general machinery of civilisation ""
""what about it in russia hastings this will be russia on an
infinitely larger scale--and with this additional menace--that madame
olivier's experiments have proceeded further than she has ever
given out i believe that she has to a certain extent succeeded
in liberating atomic energy and harnessing it to her purpose her
experiments with the nitrogen of the air have been very remarkable and she has also experimented in the concentration of wireless energy so that a beam of great intensity can be focused upon some given
spot exactly how far she has progressed nobody knows but it is
certain that it is much farther than has ever been given out she is
a genius that woman--the curies were as nothing to her add to her
genius the powers of ryland's almost unlimited wealth and with the
brain of li chang yen the finest criminal brain ever known to direct
and plan--_eh bien_ it will not be as you say all jam for
civilisation ""
his words made me very thoughtful although poirot was given at times
to exaggeration of language he was not really an alarmist for the
first time i realised what a desperate struggle it was upon which we
were engaged harvey soon rejoined us and the journey went on we arrived at bolzano about midday from there the journey on was by
motor several big blue motor-cars were waiting in the central square
of the town and we three got into one of them poirot notwithstanding
the heat of the day was muffled to the eyes in greatcoat and scarf his eyes and the tips of his ears were all that could be seen of him i did not know whether this was due to precaution or merely his
exaggerated fear of catching a chill the motor journey took a couple
of hours it was a really wonderful drive for the first part of the
way we wound in and out of huge cliffs with a trickling waterfall on
one hand then we emerged into a fertile valley which continued for
some miles and then still winding steadily upwards the bare rocky
peaks began to show with dense clustering pine woods at their base the
whole place was wild and lovely finally a series of abrupt curves with the road running through the pine woods on either side and we
came suddenly upon a big hotel and found that we had arrived our rooms had been reserved for us and under harvey's guidance we went
straight up to them they looked straight out over the rocky peaks and
the long slopes of pine woods leading up to them poirot made a gesture
towards them ""it is there "" he asked in a low voice ""yes "" replied harvey ""there is a place called the
felsenlabyrynth--all big boulders piled about in a most fantastic
way--a path winds through them the quarrying is to the right of that but we think that the entrance is probably in the felsenlabyrynth ""
poirot nodded ""come _mon ami_ "" he said to me ""let us go down and sit upon the
terrace and enjoy the sunlight ""
""you think that wise "" i asked he shrugged his shoulders the sunlight was marvellous--in fact the glare was almost too great
for me we had some creamy coffee instead of tea then went upstairs
and unpacked our few belongings poirot was in his most unapproachable
mood lost in a kind of reverie once or twice he shook his head and
sighed i had been rather intrigued by a man who had got out of our train at
bolzano and had been met by a private car he was a small man and the
thing about him that had attracted my attention was that he was almost
as much muffled up as poirot had been more so indeed for in addition
to greatcoat and muffler he was wearing huge blue spectacles i was
convinced that here we had an emissary of the big four poirot did not
seem very impressed by my idea but when leaning out of my bedroom
window i reported that the man in question was strolling about in the
vicinity of the hotel he admitted that there might be something in it i urged my friend not to go down to dinner but he insisted on doing
so we entered the dining-room rather late and were shown to a
table by the window as we sat down our attention was attracted by
an exclamation and a crash of falling china a dish of _haricots
verts_ had been upset over a man who was sitting at the table next
to ours the head waiter came up and was vociferous in apologies presently when the offending waiter was serving us with soup poirot
spoke to him ""an unfortunate accident that but it was not your fault ""
""monsieur saw that no indeed it was not my fault the gentleman half
sprung up from his chair--i thought he was going to have an attack of
some kind i could not save the catastrophe ""
i saw poirot's eyes shining with the green light i knew so well and as
the waiter departed he said to me in a low voice:--
""you see hastings the effect of hercule poirot--alive and in the
flesh ""
""you think--""
i had not time to continue i felt poirot's hand on my knee as he
whispered excitedly:
""look hastings look _his trick with the bread _ number four ""
sure enough the man at the next table to ours his face unusually
pale was dabbing a small piece of bread mechanically about the table i studied him carefully his face clean-shaven and puffily fat was
of a pasty unhealthy sallowness with heavy pouches under the eyes
and deep lines running from his nose to the corners of his mouth his
age might have been anything from thirty-five to forty-five in no
particular did he resemble any one of the characters which number four
had previously assumed indeed had it not been for his little trick
with the bread of which he was evidently quite unaware i would have
sworn readily enough that the man sitting there was some one whom i had
never seen before ""he has recognised you "" i murmured ""you should not have come down ""
""my excellent hastings i have feigned death for three months for this
one purpose ""
""to startle number four ""
""to startle him at a moment when he must act quickly or not at all and we have this great advantage--he does not know that we recognise
him he thinks that he is safe in his new disguise how i bless flossie
monro for telling us of that little habit of his ""
""what will happen now "" i asked ""what can happen he recognises the only man he fears miraculously
resurrected from the dead at the very minute when the plans of the big
four are in the balance madame olivier and abe ryland lunched here
to-day and it is thought that they went to cortina only we know that
they have retired to their hiding place how much do we know that is
what number four is asking himself at this minute he dare take no
risks i must be suppressed at all costs _eh bien_ let him try
to suppress hercule poirot i shall be ready for him ""
as he finished speaking the man at the next table got up and went out ""he has gone to make his little arrangements "" said poirot placidly ""shall we have our coffee on the terrace my friend it would be
pleasanter i think i will just go up and get a coat ""
i went out on to the terrace a little disturbed in mind poirot's
assurance did not quite content me however so long as we were on our
guard nothing could happen to us i resolved to keep thoroughly on the
alert it was quite five minutes before poirot joined me with his usual
precautions against cold he was muffled up to the ears he sat down
beside me and sipped his coffee appreciatively ""only in england is the coffee so atrocious "" he remarked ""on the
continent they understand how important it is for the digestion that it
should be properly made ""
as he finished speaking the man from the next table suddenly appeared
on the terrace without any hesitation he came over and drew up a
third chair to our table ""you do not mind my joining you i hope "" he said in english ""not at all monsieur "" said poirot i felt very uneasy it is true that we were on the terrace of the
hotel with people all round us but nevertheless i was not satisfied i sensed the presence of danger meanwhile number four chatted away in a perfectly natural manner it seemed impossible to believe that he was anything but a _bona
fide_ tourist he described excursions and motor trips and posed as
quite an authority on the neighbourhood he took a pipe from his pocket and began to light it poirot drew out
his case of tiny cigarettes as he placed one between his lips the
stranger leant forward with a match ""let me give you a light ""
as he spoke without the least warning all the lights went out there
was a chink of glass and something pungent under my nose suffocating
me--"
Chapter 18,"18 in the felsenlabyrynth
i could not have been unconscious more than a minute i came to myself
being hustled along between two men they had me under each arm supporting my weight and there was a gag in my mouth it was pitch
dark but i gathered that we were not outside but passing through the
hotel all round i could hear people shouting and demanding in every
known language what had happened to the lights my captors swung me
down some stairs we passed along a basement passage then through a
door and out into the open again through a glass door at the back of
the hotel in another moment we had gained the shelter of the pine
trees i had caught a glimpse of another figure in a similar plight to myself and realised that poirot too was a victim of this bold coup by sheer audacity number four had won the day he had employed i
gathered an instant Ã¦sthetic probably ethyl chloride--breaking
a small bulb of it under our noses then in the confusion of the
darkness his accomplices who had probably been guests sitting at the
next table had thrust gags in our mouths and hurried us away taking
us through the hotel to baffle pursuit i cannot describe the hour that followed we were hurried through the
woods at a break-neck pace going uphill the whole time at last we
emerged in the open on the mountain-side and i saw just in front of
us an extraordinary conglomeration of fantastic rocks and boulders this must be the felsenlabyrynth of which harvey had spoken soon we
were winding in and out of its recesses the place was like a maze
devised by some evil genie suddenly we stopped an enormous rock barred our path one of the men
stooped and seemed to push on something when without a sound the huge
mass of rock turned on itself and disclosed a small tunnel-like opening
leading into the mountain-side into this we were hurried for some time the tunnel was narrow but
presently it widened and before very long we came out into a wide
rocky chamber lighted by electricity there the gags were removed at a
sign from number four who stood facing us with mocking triumph in his
face we were searched and every article was removed from our pockets including poirot's little automatic pistol a pang smote me as it was tossed down on the table we were
defeated--hopelessly defeated and outnumbered it was the end ""welcome to the headquarters of the big four m hercule poirot "" said
number four in a mocking tone ""to meet you again is an unexpected
pleasure but was it worth while returning from the grave only for
this ""
poirot did not reply i dared not look at him ""come this way "" continued number four ""your arrival will be somewhat
of a surprise to my colleagues ""
he indicated a narrow doorway in the wall we passed through and found
ourselves in another chamber at the very end of it was a table behind
which four chairs were placed the end chair was empty but was draped
with a mandarin's cape on the second smoking a cigar sat mr abe
ryland leaning back in the third chair with her burning eyes and her
nun's face was madame olivier number four took his seat on the fourth
chair we were in the presence of the big four never before had i felt so fully the reality and the presence of li
chang yen as i did now when confronting his empty seat far away in
china he yet controlled and directed this malign organisation madame olivier gave a faint cry on seeing us ryland more
self-controlled only shifted his cigar and raised his grizzled
eyebrows ""m hercule poirot "" said ryland slowly ""this is a pleasant surprise you put it over on us all right we thought you were good and buried no matter the game is up now ""
there was a ring as of steel in his voice madame olivier said nothing but her eyes burned and i disliked the slow way she smiled ""madame and messieurs i wish you good-evening "" said poirot quietly something unexpected something i had not been prepared to hear in his
voice made me look at him he seemed quite composed yet there was
something about his whole appearance that was different then there was a stir of draperies behind us and the countess vera
rossakoff came in ""ah "" said number four ""our valued and trusted lieutenant an old
friend of yours is here my dear lady ""
the countess whirled round with her usual vehemence of movement ""god in heaven "" she cried ""it is the little man ah but he has
the nine lives of a cat oh little man little man why did you mix
yourself up in this ""
""madame "" said poirot with a bow ""me like the great napoleon i am
on the side of the big battalions ""
as he spoke i saw a sudden suspicion flash into her eyes and at the
same moment i knew the truth which subconsciously i already sensed the man beside me was not hercule poirot he was very like him extraordinarily like him there was the same
egg-shaped head the same strutting figure delicately plump but the
voice was different and the eyes instead of being green were dark and
surely the moustaches--those famous moustaches-- my reflections were cut short by the countess's voice she stepped
forward her voice ringing with excitement ""you have been deceived that man is not hercule poirot ""
number four uttered an incredulous exclamation but the countess leant
forward and snatched at poirot's moustaches they came off in her hand and then indeed the truth was plain for this man's upper lip was
disfigured by a small scar which completely altered the expression of
the face ""not hercule poirot "" muttered number four ""but who can he be then ""
""i know "" i cried suddenly and then stopped dead afraid i had ruined
everything but the man i will still refer to as poirot had turned to me
encouragingly ""say it if you will it makes no matter now the trick has succeeded ""
""this is achille poirot "" i said slowly ""hercule poirot's twin
brother ""
""impossible "" said ryland sharply but he was shaken ""hercule's plan has succeeded to a marvel "" said achille placidly number four leapt forward his voice harsh and menacing ""succeeded has it "" he snarled ""do you realise that before many
minutes have passed you will be dead--dead ""
""yes "" said achille poirot gravely ""i realise that it is you who do
not realise that a man may be willing to purchase success by his life there were men who laid down their lives for their country in the war i am prepared to lay down mine in the same way for the world ""
it struck me just then that although perfectly willing to lay down my
life i might have been consulted in the matter then i remembered how
poirot had urged me to stay behind and i felt appeased ""and in what way will your laying down your life benefit the world ""
asked ryland sardonically ""i see that you do not perceive the true inwardness of hercule's
plan to begin with your place of retreat was known some months
ago and practically all the visitors hotel assistants and others
are detectives or secret service men a cordon has been drawn round
the mountain you may have more than one means of egress but even
so you cannot escape poirot himself is directing the operations
outside my boots were smeared with a preparation of aniseed to-night before i came down to the terrace in my brother's place hounds are
following the trail it will lead them infallibly to the rock in the
felsenlabyrynth where the entrance is situated you see do what you
will to us the net is drawn tightly round you you cannot escape ""
madame olivier laughed suddenly ""you are wrong there is one way we can escape and like samson of
old destroy our enemies at the same time what do you say my friends ""
ryland was staring at achille poirot ""suppose he's lying "" he said hoarsely the other shrugged his shoulders ""in an hour it will be dawn then you can see for yourself the truth
of my words already they should have traced me to the entrance in the
felsenlabyrynth ""
even as he spoke there was a far off reverberation and a man ran in
shouting incoherently ryland sprang up and went out madame olivier
moved to the end of the room and opened a door that i had not noticed inside i caught a glimpse of a perfectly equipped laboratory which
reminded me of the one in paris number four also sprang up and went
out he returned with poirot's revolver which he gave to the countess ""there is no danger of their escaping "" he said grimly ""but still you
had better have this ""
then he went out again the countess came over to us and surveyed my companion attentively for
some time suddenly she laughed ""you are very clever m achille poirot "" she said mockingly ""madame let us talk business it is fortunate that they have left us
alone together what is your price ""
""i do not understand what price ""
""madame you can aid us to escape you know the secret ways out of this
retreat i ask you what is your price ""
she laughed again ""more than you could pay little man why all the money in the world
would not buy me ""
""madame i did not speak of money i am a man of intelligence nevertheless this is a true fact--_everyone has his price_ in
exchange for life and liberty i offer you your heart's desire ""
""so you are a magician ""
""you can call me so if you like ""
the countess suddenly dropped her jesting manner she spoke with
passionate bitterness ""fool my heart's desire can you give me revenge upon my enemies can
you give me back youth and beauty and a gay heart can you bring the
dead to life again ""
achille poirot was watching her very curiously ""which of the three madame make your choice ""
she laughed sardonically ""you will sell me the elixir of life perhaps come i will make a
bargain with you once i had a child find my child for me--and you
shall go free ""
""madame i agree it is a bargain your child shall be restored to you on the faith of--on the faith of hercule poirot himself ""
again that strange woman laughed--this time long and unrestrainedly ""my dear m poirot i am afraid i laid a little trap for you it is
very kind of you to promise to find my child for me but you see i
happen to know that you would not succeed and so that would be a very
one-sided bargain would it not ""
""madame i swear to you by the holy angels that i will restore your
child to you ""
""i asked you before m poirot could you restore the dead to life ""
""then the child is--""
""dead yes ""
he stepped forward and took her wrist ""madame i--i who speak to you swear once more _i will bring the
dead to life _""
she stared at him as though fascinated ""you do not believe me i will prove my words get my pocket-book which
they took from me ""
she went out of the room and returned with it in her hand throughout
all she retained her grip on the revolver i felt that achille poirot's
chances of bluffing her were very slight the countess vera rossakoff
was no fool ""open it madame the flap on the left-hand side that is right now
take out that photograph and look at it ""
wonderingly she took out what seemed to be a small snapshot no sooner
had she looked at it than she uttered a cry and swayed as though about
to fall then she almost flew at my companion ""where where you shall tell me where ""
""remember your bargain madame ""
""yes yes i will trust you quick before they come back ""
catching him by the hand she drew him quickly and silently out of
the room i followed from the outer room she led us into the tunnel
by which we had first entered but a short way along this forked and
she turned off to the right again and again the passage divided but
she led us on never faltering or seeming to doubt her way and with
increasing speed ""if only we are in time "" she panted ""we must be out in the open
before the explosion occurs ""
still we went on i understood that this tunnel led right through the
mountain and that we should finally emerge on the other side facing a
different valley the sweat streamed down my face but i raced on and then far away i saw a gleam of daylight nearer and nearer i saw
green bushes growing we forced them aside pushed our way through we
were in the open again with the faint light of dawn making everything
rosy poirot's cordon was a reality even as we emerged three men fell upon
us but released us again with a cry of astonishment ""quick "" cried my companion ""quick--there is no time to lose--""
but he was not destined to finish the earth shook and trembled under
our feet there was a terrific roar and the whole mountain seemed to
dissolve we were flung headlong through the air * * * * *
i came to myself at last i was in a strange bed and a strange room some one was sitting by the window he turned and came and stood by me it was achille poirot--or stay was it--
the well-known ironical voice dispelled any doubts i might have had ""but yes my friend it is i brother achille has gone home again--to
the land of myths it was i all the time it is not only number four
who can act a part belladona in the eyes the sacrifice of the
moustaches and a real scar the inflicting of which caused me much pain
two months ago--but i could not risk a fake beneath the eagle eyes of
number four and the final touch your own knowledge and belief that
there was such a person as achille poirot it was invaluable the
assistance you rendered me half the success of the coup is due to you the whole crux of the affair was to make them believe that hercule
poirot was still at large directing operations otherwise everything
was true the aniseed the cordon etc ""
""but why not really send a substitute ""
""and let you go into danger without me by your side you have a pretty
idea of me there besides i always had a hope of finding a way out
through the countess ""
""how on earth did you manage to convince her it was a pretty thin
story to make her swallow--all that about a dead child ""
""the countess has a great deal more perspicacity than you have my dear
hastings she was taken in at first by my disguise; but she soon saw
through it when she said 'you are very clever m achille poirot ' i
knew that she had guessed the truth it was then or never to play my
trump card ""
""all that rigmarole about bringing the dead to life ""
""exactly--but then you see i had the child all along ""
""_what _""
""but yes you know my motto--be prepared as soon as i found that the
countess rossakoff was mixed up with the big four i had every possible
inquiry made as to her antecedents i learnt that she had had a child
who was reported to have been killed and i also found that there were
discrepancies in the story which led me to wonder whether it might not after all be alive in the end i succeeded in tracing the boy and
by paying out a big sum i obtained possession of the child's person the poor little fellow was nearly dead of starvation i placed him in a
safe place with kindly people and took a snapshot of him in his new
surroundings and so when the time came i had my little _coup de
thÃ©Ã¢tre_ all ready ""
""you are wonderful poirot; absolutely wonderful ""
""i was glad to do it too for i had admired the countess i should
have been sorry if she had perished in the explosion ""
""i've been half afraid to ask you--what of the big four ""
""all the bodies have now been recovered that of number four was quite
unrecognisable the head blown to pieces i wish--i rather wish it had
not been so i should have liked to be _sure_--but no more of
that look at this ""
he handed me a newspaper in which a paragraph was marked it reported
the death by suicide of li chang yen who had engineered the recent
revolution which had failed so disastrously ""my great opponent "" said poirot gravely ""it was fated that he and
i should never meet in the flesh when he received the news of the
disaster here he took the simplest way out a great brain my friend a great brain but i wish i had seen the face of the man who was number
four supposing that after all--but i romance he is dead yes _mon ami_ together we have faced and routed the big four; and now
you will return to your charming wife and i--i shall retire the great
